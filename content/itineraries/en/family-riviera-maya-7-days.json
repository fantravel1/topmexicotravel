      "question": "What's the best age for kids on this trip?",
      "answer": "This itinerary works great for ages 4-14. Toddlers can enjoy it too, but may miss out on some activities. Teens may want more adventure—consider adding ATV tours or zip-lining for older kids. Babies are welcome but require more logistics (strollers on sand, nap schedules, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Mexican resorts really all-inclusive?",
      "answer": "Yes, most Riviera Maya family resorts are truly all-inclusive: all meals, drinks (including alcohol for adults), snacks, room service, non-motorized water sports, kids' clubs, and entertainment. Spa, excursions, and premium restaurants may cost extra. Read the fine print for your specific resort."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to travel to Mexico with kids?",
      "answer": "The Riviera Maya is very safe for families. It's one of Mexico's most visited tourist regions with excellent infrastructure. Stick to tourist areas, use reputable tour operators, and take normal precautions. Crime against tourists is rare. The biggest risks are sunburn, jellyfish stings, and tummy troubles from new foods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we do Xcaret or Xel-Há?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent, but they're different. Xcaret is more varied with cultural shows, wildlife, and activities—better for families wanting variety and older kids. Xel-Há is a giant natural water park focused on snorkeling and swimming—better for water-loving families and younger kids. Many families do both on a week trip."
