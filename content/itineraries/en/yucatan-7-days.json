      "question": "Should I rent a car?",
      "answer": "Highly recommended. A rental car ($30-50/day) gives you freedom to visit cenotes, leave early for ruins, and explore at your pace. Without a car, you'll rely on expensive tours or slow public buses."

      "question": "Is the Yucatán safe?",
      "answer": "The Yucatán Peninsula is one of Mexico's safest regions. Tourism is the main industry, and the area is well-policed. Use normal precautions (secure valuables, avoid isolated areas at night)."

      "question": "What's the best time to visit?",
      "answer": "November to April is dry season with warm weather and low humidity. Avoid Spring Break (March) for fewer crowds. Summer is hot and humid with afternoon rain but fewer tourists and lower prices."
