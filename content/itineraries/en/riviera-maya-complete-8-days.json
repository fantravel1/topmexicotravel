    {
      "question": "What about all-inclusive resorts?",

    {
      "question": "Is it safe to drive?",
      "answer": "Yes. Roads are good, well-signed, and safe. Don't drive at night in remote areas. Watch for speed bumps (topes) in towns. Toll roads are worth the cost for faster, safer travel."
