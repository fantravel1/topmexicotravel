  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why start in San Miguel instead of Mexico City?",
      "answer": "San Miguel is the natural starting point for the colonial heartland and avoids Mexico City's size and complexity. If you want to include CDMX, add 2-3 days at the beginning. From there, it's a 4-hour drive or bus to San Miguel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this trip suitable for older travelers?",
      "answer": "Yes, with caveats. The colonial cities are hilly with uneven cobblestones. Altitude (6,000+ feet) can affect those with health issues. But the pace is relaxed, there's excellent food and lodging, and many activities involve sitting and observing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I book the Tequila Express in advance?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. It only runs weekends and sells out, especially in high season. Book directly through Jose Cuervo's website at least 2 weeks ahead. If you miss it, driving to Tequila independently is still wonderful."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to extend this trip?",
      "answer": "Add 2-3 days in Mexico City at the beginning (fly into MEX, bus to San Miguel). Or add Morelia (2-3 days) between Guanajuato and Guadalajara—another gorgeous colonial city with fewer tourists. Pátzcuaro and its island are nearby."
