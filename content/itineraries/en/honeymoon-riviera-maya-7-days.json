      "question": "Which all-inclusive resort is best for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "For romantic atmosphere: Secrets Maroma Beach has the best beach. For suite quality: Excellence Playa Mujeres with Excellence Club. For value: Dreams Riviera Cancún offers Unlimited-Luxury at lower prices. For ultimate luxury: UNICO 20°87° or Rosewood Mayakoba. All cater beautifully to honeymooners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we need to leave the resort at all?",
      "answer": "No—you could spend all 7 days at the resort and have a wonderful honeymoon. The excursions (cenote, Tulum, Playa del Carmen) add variety and memories, but they're optional. Many honeymooners prefer maximum resort time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it better to book through the resort or a travel agent?",
      "answer": "Travel agents specializing in honeymoons (especially Virtuoso agents) often get extras: room upgrades, resort credits, special amenities. They also handle any issues. For luxury properties, agent booking almost always adds value. For moderate resorts, direct booking with honeymoon package often works fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we get travel insurance for our honeymoon?",
      "answer": "Absolutely yes. You've just spent significant money on a wedding; protecting your honeymoon investment is wise. Look for policies covering trip cancellation, medical emergencies, and flight delays. Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) policies offer maximum flexibility."
