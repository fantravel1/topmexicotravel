    "getting_there": "Fly into Los Mochis (LMM) or Chihuahua (CUU) from Mexico City, Guadalajara, or other hubs. The route can be done either direction. West-to-east (Los Mochis to Chihuahua) means climbing into the canyons; east-to-west descends.",
    "el_chepe_train": "Two services: El Chepe Regional (cheaper, stops at all stations, more flexible) and El Chepe Express (first class, fewer stops, meals included). Book at chepe.com.mx or through tour operators. Trains run roughly 3 times per week.",
    "when_to_go": "October-November has fall colors and comfortable temperatures. March-April is spring, wildflowers possible. Summer (July-Sept) is rainy season—often foggy, views obscured. Winter is cold at altitude but clear; canyon bottoms stay warm.",

    "money": "Limited ATMs outside Creel and Chihuahua. Bring cash (pesos). Cards accepted at larger hotels/lodges."
