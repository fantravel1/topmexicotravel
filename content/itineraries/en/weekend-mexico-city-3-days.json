This itinerary covers the essentials—Centro, museums, Roma/Condesa, Coyoacán—but you won't have time for Teotihuacán, Xochimilco, or deep neighborhood exploration. Consider it a taste that makes you want to return."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about Teotihuacán pyramids?",
      "answer": "The pyramids are incredible but require a full day (1+ hour each way plus 3-4 hours on site). With only 3 days, we recommend saving it for a longer trip. If you must go, replace Day 2 morning and skip the Anthropology Museum."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should I stay?",
      "answer": "Roma Norte or Condesa are ideal—walkable, safe, full of restaurants. Centro Histórico works for history buffs but is less lively at night. Polanco is upscale but further from nightlife. Avoid areas far from these neighborhoods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mexico City safe for a weekend trip?",
      "answer": "The tourist areas (Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Centro, Coyoacán) are safe. Use Uber instead of street taxis at night. Don't flash expensive items. You're as safe as in any major world city with basic urban awareness."
