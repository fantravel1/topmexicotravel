      "question": "Is driving in Baja safe?",
      "answer": "Yes—Baja is one of Mexico's safest regions for tourists. Highway 1 is well-maintained. Don't drive at night (animals, potholes, no lighting). Keep your tank above half-full. Carry emergency supplies. The biggest dangers are mechanical issues and running out of gas, not crime."

    {
      "question": "When is whale watching season?",
      "answer": "Gray whales: January-March in Guerrero Negro/San Ignacio lagoons, peak February. Whale sharks: October-April in La Paz, peak November-February. Humpback whales (Los Cabos): December-April. Plan your trip around these seasons for maximum wildlife."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent a car from the US and drive into Mexico?",
      "answer": "Some US rental companies allow this, but Mexican insurance is required by law—US insurance doesn't cover you in Mexico. Best approach: rent from a Mexican company at the border or airport, or buy Mexican insurance separately. This is critical—don't skip it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the full drive take?",
      "answer": "Tijuana to Los Cabos is about 1,000 miles on Highway 1. You could drive it in 2-3 very long days, but that misses the point. This 10-day itinerary allows proper exploration with 4-6 hours of driving most days, plus full days for activities."
