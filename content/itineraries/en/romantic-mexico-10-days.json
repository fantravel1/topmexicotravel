      "question": "Is this itinerary too rushed for a honeymoon?",
      "answer": "It's active but not rushed. Each stop has 3 nights, giving you 2 full days per destination. The variety (beach, colonial, desert) keeps things exciting. If you prefer slower travel, extend each stop by 1-2 nights or choose just 2 of the 3 destinations."

      "question": "What's the best time of year for this honeymoon?",
      "answer": "November to April offers the best weather at all three destinations. December and February are popular for weddings/honeymoons—book well ahead. Avoid spring break weeks (March) if you want tranquility. Shoulder season (May, early December) offers deals."

      "question": "How do we let hotels know we're on our honeymoon?",
      "answer": "Tell them! When booking and at check-in, mention it's your honeymoon. Most hotels offer complimentary upgrades, champagne, room decorations, or special amenities for honeymooners. The more advance notice, the more they can prepare."

      "question": "Can we combine this with our wedding in Mexico?",
