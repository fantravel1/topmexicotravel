      "question": "How much mezcal can I bring home?",
      "answer": "US allows 5 liters per person duty-free. Beyond that, you pay taxes. Most mezcal from palenques comes in 750ml bottles, so you can bring ~6 bottles duty-free. Pack in checked luggage, well-wrapped. Consider shipping larger quantities through specialty importers."
