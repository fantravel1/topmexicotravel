    {
      "question": "When is whale watching season in Baja?",
      "answer": "Gray whales visit Baja's Pacific lagoons (Magdalena Bay, San Ignacio) from December to April, with February being peak season. Whale sharks are in the Sea of Cortez near La Paz from October to April. Humpback whales pass through Los Cabos November to March."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to swim with whale sharks?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Whale sharks are gentle filter feeders—they eat plankton, not people. They can grow up to 40 feet but are completely docile. Reputable operators follow strict guidelines for safe, respectful encounters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do this trip without a car?",
      "answer": "It's possible but limiting. You could base in Los Cabos and take day tours to Todos Santos and La Paz. However, a rental car gives you flexibility to explore at your own pace and stop at scenic viewpoints along the way."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Cabos expensive?",
      "answer": "The Cabo corridor has resort pricing—expect to pay US-level prices at hotels and high-end restaurants. However, Todos Santos and La Paz are more affordable, and tacos are cheap everywhere. A mid-range trip is very doable."
