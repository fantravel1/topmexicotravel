  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas?",
      "answer": "San José del Cabo is quieter, more romantic, with colonial charm, art galleries, and sophisticated dining. Cabo San Lucas is livelier with nightlife, party boats, and marina action. Most honeymooners prefer San José or the corridor between them for tranquility."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is whale watching season?",
      "answer": "Humpback and gray whales visit Los Cabos from December through April, with peak sightings in January through March. This is an extraordinary experience worth timing your honeymoon around if you're flexible. Private charters offer the most intimate encounters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the beaches swimmable?",
      "answer": "Many are not—Pacific currents can be dangerous. Swimmable beaches include Chileno Bay, Santa Maria Bay, and Medano Beach (Cabo San Lucas). Most luxury resorts on the corridor have protected coves or excellent pools. Always check conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Cabos expensive compared to Riviera Maya?",
      "answer": "Generally yes. Los Cabos attracts a higher-end clientele and has fewer budget all-inclusive options. You'll pay more for comparable luxury but get a completely different landscape and experience. The farm-to-table dining scene is exceptional."
