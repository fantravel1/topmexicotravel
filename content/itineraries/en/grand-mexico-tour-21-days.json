      "question": "Can I shorten this itinerary?",

      "question": "What's the best time of year for this trip?",
      "answer": "October to April offers the best overall conditions. The Yucatán and Pacific coast are hot and humid in summer. Highland cities (CDMX, Oaxaca, San Miguel) are pleasant year-round but can be cold in winter. Rainy season (June-October) brings afternoon showers but also green landscapes."

      "question": "How much internal flying is required?",
      "answer": "This itinerary includes 5-6 internal flights. You could reduce flights by taking overnight buses (CDMX-Oaxaca is a popular route), but this adds time. Mexican buses are excellent—first-class buses rival flying for comfort on some routes."
