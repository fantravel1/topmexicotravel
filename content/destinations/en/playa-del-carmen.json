This walkable beach town features the famous Quinta Avenida pedestrian street, beautiful white-sand beaches, easy ferry access to Cozumel, and serves as the ideal base for exploring cenotes and Mayan ruins.",
  "introduction": "<p>Once a sleepy fishing village and ferry departure point for Cozumel, Playa del Carmen has blossomed into a cosmopolitan beach destination that attracts a diverse mix of visitors—from families and couples to digital nomads and expats. The heart of town is Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue), a bustling pedestrian street running parallel to the beach, lined with restaurants, bars, shops, and street performers.</p><p>Unlike Cancún's isolated Hotel Zone, Playa puts you right in the action. You can walk from your hotel to the beach, grab street tacos, browse boutiques, and end the night at a rooftop bar—all without a taxi. The town also serves as the Riviera Maya's most convenient base: ferries to Cozumel depart every 30 minutes, cenotes are within a short drive, and Tulum is just 45 minutes south.</p><p>Whether you want all-inclusive luxury or a budget-friendly apartment, beach days or archaeological adventures, Playa del Carmen delivers the quintessential Mexican Caribbean experience with a cosmopolitan twist.</p>",

Playa is better for diverse restaurants, local flavor, and exploration on foot. Cancún is better for mega-resorts, nightclub districts, and consistently calm Caribbean beaches. Both are excellent choices depending on your travel style."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get from Cancún airport to Playa del Carmen?",
      "answer": "Playa del Carmen is about 55 minutes south of Cancún airport. Options include: ADO bus (frequent, $12-15 USD, drops at 5th Avenue—most convenient), private transfer ($60-80 USD), shared shuttle ($20-30 per person), or rental car. The ADO bus terminal is right outside arrivals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Playa del Carmen safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "The tourist areas of Playa del Carmen (5th Avenue, beach, central neighborhoods) are generally safe. Exercise normal precautions: avoid excessive displays of wealth, use ATMs inside stores, and stick to well-lit areas after dark. Most visitors have trouble-free trips."
