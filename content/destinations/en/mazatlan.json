It offers authentic Mexican beach culture without the resort-only atmosphere.",
  "introduction": "<p>Mazatlán has been a beach destination since the 1800s, long before Cancún was imagined. For decades it faded as tourists headed to newer resorts, but a major renovation of the historic center has sparked a revival. Today, Mazatlán offers the rare combination of genuine Mexican culture and excellent beaches.</p><p>The centro histórico is a revelation: block after block of beautifully restored 19th-century buildings, the ornate Angela Peralta theater, craft breweries, excellent restaurants, and lively plazas. The malecón—at 21 kilometers, the longest in Mexico—connects the old town to the beaches of the Zona Dorada.</p><p>Beyond the beaches, Mazatlán is known for banda music (which originated here), fresh seafood, and one of Mexico's wildest Carnaval celebrations. It's a real city with a working port and local character, not a purpose-built resort zone.</p>",
