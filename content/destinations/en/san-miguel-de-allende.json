    "snippet": "San Miguel de Allende is Mexico's most picturesque colonial town—a UNESCO World Heritage site where cobblestone streets wind past pastel-colored buildings beneath the fairy-tale spires of the iconic Parroquia church. Repeatedly voted 'Best City in the World' by Travel + Leisure readers, this artistic haven offers timeless charm, sophisticated dining, and a thriving expat community.",
    "full": "Founded in 1542, San Miguel de Allende played a crucial role in Mexican independence and has been carefully preserved ever since. The entire historic center is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site, with not a single power line or neon sign to disrupt the colonial aesthetic. The town's unlikely landmark, the neo-Gothic Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel, was redesigned in the late 1800s by a self-taught indigenous mason reportedly inspired by European cathedral postcards.\n\nSan Miguel has attracted artists and writers since the 1930s, and today hosts a vibrant creative community alongside a large expat population (some estimate 10-15% of residents are foreigners). This international influence has created an unusually sophisticated dining and shopping scene for a town of its size, with galleries, boutiques, and restaurants rivaling those in major cities. Yet San Miguel remains unmistakably Mexican, from the mariachis in the jardín to the family-owned shops selling traditional crafts. Whether you're drawn by art, food, architecture, or simply the magic of walking these timeless streets, San Miguel de Allende casts a spell that keeps visitors returning."
