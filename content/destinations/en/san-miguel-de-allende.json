Repeatedly voted 'Best City in the World' by Travel + Leisure, this artistic haven offers timeless charm, sophisticated dining, and a thriving creative community.",
  "introduction": "<p>Founded in 1542, San Miguel de Allende played a crucial role in Mexican independence and has been carefully preserved ever since. The entire historic center is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site, with not a single power line or neon sign to disrupt the colonial aesthetic. The town's unlikely landmark, the neo-Gothic Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel, was redesigned in the late 1800s by a self-taught indigenous mason reportedly inspired by European cathedral postcards.</p><p>San Miguel has attracted artists and writers since the 1930s, and today hosts a vibrant creative community alongside a large expat population. This international influence has created an unusually sophisticated dining and shopping scene for a town of its size, with galleries, boutiques, and restaurants rivaling those in major cities.</p><p>Yet San Miguel remains unmistakably Mexican, from the mariachis in the jardín to the family-owned shops selling traditional crafts. Whether you're drawn by art, food, architecture, or simply the magic of walking these timeless streets, San Miguel de Allende casts a spell that keeps visitors returning for decades.</p>",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is San Miguel de Allende so popular?",
      "answer": "San Miguel combines stunning colonial architecture, perfect weather (mild year-round at 6,200 feet), safety, walkability, a thriving arts scene, and sophisticated dining. The UNESCO-protected town has been repeatedly voted 'Best City in the World' by Travel + Leisure readers. A large expat community has created international-quality amenities while preserving Mexican charm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to San Miguel de Allende?",
      "answer": "The nearest major airport is León/Bajío (BJX), about 1.5 hours away. Querétaro airport (QRO) is slightly closer but has fewer flights. From Mexico City airport or bus station, it's about 3-4 hours by car or luxury ETN/Primera Plus bus. Many visitors combine San Miguel with Guanajuato city."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is San Miguel de Allende expensive?",
      "answer": "San Miguel is one of Mexico's more expensive destinations, especially for accommodation and dining in tourist areas. Luxury hotels can exceed $500/night, though charming mid-range options exist for $100-200. Eating at local spots in the markets is much cheaper than tourist restaurants. Budget travelers can manage with careful planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in San Miguel de Allende?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal for exploring the historic center, visiting galleries, and experiencing the food scene. Add another day for the hot springs and Atotonilco sanctuary. Add a day trip to Guanajuato for the full experience. Many visitors extend their stay or return repeatedly—San Miguel has a way of capturing hearts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is San Miguel de Allende safe?",
