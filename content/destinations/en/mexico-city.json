    "snippet": "Mexico City (CDMX) is one of the world's largest and most dynamic capitals, offering an intoxicating blend of ancient Aztec heritage, Spanish colonial architecture, and cutting-edge contemporary culture. With over 150 museums, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and arguably the best food scene in the Americas, this megacity rewards curious travelers.",
    "full": "Built on the ruins of the ancient Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, Mexico City is a sprawling metropolis of over 21 million people that defies easy categorization. The historic center (Centro Histórico) showcases magnificent colonial buildings and the excavated Templo Mayor, while trendy neighborhoods like Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán offer tree-lined streets, Art Deco architecture, and some of the best restaurants in Latin America.\n\nThe city's cultural offerings are unmatched: the National Museum of Anthropology houses the world's finest collection of pre-Columbian artifacts, Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul provides intimate insight into the iconic artist's life, and the floating gardens of Xochimilco offer a glimpse of the city's pre-Hispanic past. From world-class galleries to underground speakeasies, from street taco stands to Michelin-starred restaurants, Mexico City delivers experiences that rival any global capital at a fraction of the cost."

    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Mexico City?",

      "answer": "At 2,240 meters (7,350 feet), some visitors experience mild altitude effects like shortness of breath, headaches, or fatigue. Stay hydrated, avoid alcohol on arrival day, and take it easy for the first 24 hours. Most people adjust within a day or two."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around Mexico City?",
      "answer": "The metro is extensive and cheap ($0.25 USD) but crowded during rush hours. Uber and DiDi are widely used and affordable. The Metrobús is efficient for major corridors. Walking is pleasant in Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán. Avoid driving yourself due to traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time to visit Mexico City?",
