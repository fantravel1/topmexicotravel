    "snippet": "Mexico City (CDMX) is one of the world's largest and most dynamic capitals, offering an intoxicating blend of ancient Aztec heritage, Spanish colonial architecture, and cutting-edge contemporary culture. With over 150 museums, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and arguably the best food scene in the Americas, this megacity rewards curious travelers with experiences that rival any global capital.",
    "full": "Built on the ruins of the ancient Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, Mexico City is a sprawling metropolis of over 21 million people that defies easy categorization. The historic center (Centro Histórico) showcases magnificent colonial buildings and the excavated Templo Mayor, while trendy neighborhoods like Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán offer tree-lined streets, Art Deco architecture, and some of the best restaurants in Latin America.\n\nThe city's cultural offerings are unmatched: the National Museum of Anthropology houses the world's finest collection of pre-Columbian artifacts, Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul provides intimate insight into the iconic artist's life, and the floating gardens of Xochimilco offer a glimpse of the city's pre-Hispanic past. From world-class galleries to underground speakeasies, from street taco stands to Michelin-starred restaurants, Mexico City delivers experiences that rival any global capital at a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhat makes CDMX truly special is how ancient and modern coexist seamlessly. You can start your morning at Aztec ruins, lunch at a cutting-edge contemporary restaurant, spend the afternoon in world-class museums, and end the evening in rooftop bars overlooking a city that never sleeps. This is a place where every neighborhood tells a different story, every meal is an adventure, and every visit reveals new layers of one of the world's most fascinating cities."

    {
      "question": "Is Mexico City safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Mexico City's main tourist areas like Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Coyoacán, and Centro Histórico are generally safe during the day. Use common sense: take registered taxis or Uber at night, avoid displaying expensive items, and stay aware of your surroundings. The metro is safe during the day but can be crowded. Millions of tourists visit safely each year."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "Plan for at least 4-5 days to experience Mexico City's highlights, including major museums, the historic center, a day trip to Teotihuacán, and exploring different neighborhoods. Food lovers and culture enthusiasts could easily spend 7-10 days. Many travelers extend their stay once they experience the city's depth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best neighborhood to stay in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "Roma and Condesa are the most popular for tourists, offering walkable streets, excellent restaurants, and a safe atmosphere. Polanco is upscale and convenient for museums. Centro Histórico puts you at the heart of history but is busier and louder. Coyoacán offers a quieter, more local experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I experience altitude sickness in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "At 2,240 meters (7,350 feet), some visitors experience mild altitude effects like shortness of breath, headaches, or fatigue. Stay hydrated, avoid alcohol on arrival day, and take it easy for the first 24 hours. Most people adjust within a day or two. If coming from sea level, don't plan strenuous activities for your first day."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around Mexico City?",
      "answer": "The metro is extensive, efficient, and cheap ($0.25 USD) but crowded during rush hours. Uber and DiDi are widely used, affordable, and safer than street taxis. The Metrobús is efficient for major corridors. Walking is pleasant in Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán. Avoid driving yourself due to heavy traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time to visit Mexico City?",
      "answer": "March to May offers warm, dry weather before the rainy season. The rainy season (June-October) brings afternoon showers but mornings are usually clear. November-February is cooler and drier. December offers festive decorations, while Day of the Dead (late October/early November) is spectacular but busy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the tap water safe to drink in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "No, don't drink tap water. Bottled water is inexpensive and widely available. Restaurants and hotels use purified water for ice and cooking, so ice is generally safe. Stick to bottled or purified water to avoid any stomach issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to speak Spanish in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "While Spanish is essential for local markets and smaller establishments, you can get by with English in tourist areas, upscale restaurants, and hotels. Learning basic Spanish phrases will greatly enhance your experience and is appreciated by locals. Download a translation app as backup."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I not miss in Mexico City?",
      "answer": "Must-sees include the National Museum of Anthropology (half-day minimum), Zócalo and Centro Histórico, Teotihuacán pyramids, the Frida Kahlo Museum (book ahead), and exploring Roma/Condesa neighborhoods. Don't skip the food - from street tacos to world-class restaurants, eating is an essential part of the experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mexico City expensive?",
      "answer": "Mexico City offers incredible value compared to major world capitals. Street food costs $1-3, excellent restaurant meals $15-30, and even top restaurants are half the price of equivalents in New York or London. Budget travelers can explore comfortably on $50/day, while mid-range travelers might spend $100-150/day including hotels."

    "getting_there": "Mexico City International Airport (MEX) is Latin America's busiest airport with direct flights from major world cities. The new Felipe Ángeles International Airport (NLU) north of the city handles some international flights. From the airport, take Uber or authorized taxi to your hotel (30-60 minutes depending on traffic).",
    "getting_around": "The metro is extensive and dirt cheap but crowded during rush hours. Uber and DiDi are the safest, most convenient options. Metrobús runs dedicated lanes on major corridors. Walking is pleasant in Roma, Condesa, Polanco, and Coyoacán. Avoid driving - traffic is brutal and parking difficult.",
    "safety_info": "Stick to tourist-friendly neighborhoods (Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Centro Histórico during day, Coyoacán). Use Uber or DiDi instead of street taxis. Don't flash expensive jewelry or electronics. The metro is generally safe but watch for pickpockets during rush hour. Follow the same common-sense precautions you'd use in any major city."
