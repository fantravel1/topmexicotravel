Just 2 hours from Mexico City, it combines historical significance (Mexican independence was planned here) with contemporary sophistication.",
  "introduction": "<p>Querétaro is having a moment. This prosperous colonial city, long overshadowed by nearby San Miguel de Allende, has emerged as one of Mexico's most livable and lovable destinations. The historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with baroque churches, elegant plazas, and the iconic 18th-century aqueduct. But unlike museum-piece towns, Querétaro pulses with contemporary energy: excellent restaurants, craft breweries, thriving tech industry, and some of Mexico's best wine country just outside town.</p><p>History runs deep here. The conspiracy that sparked Mexican independence was hatched in Querétaro. Emperor Maximilian was executed here, ending French intervention. The Mexican Constitution was signed here in 1917. Today, that heritage mingles with entrepreneurial spirit—aerospace companies, software firms, and creative businesses have made Querétaro one of Mexico's economic engines.</p><p>For travelers, Querétaro offers colonial beauty without tourist crowds, excellent food scene at fair prices, safe walkable streets, and easy access to the magical Sierra Gorda and wine route. It's perfect as a base for exploring central Mexico or as a destination in its own right.</p>",

      "question": "How is Querétaro different from San Miguel de Allende?",
      "answer": "San Miguel is more touristy and expat-focused with higher prices. Querétaro is a working city with its own economy beyond tourism, meaning more authentic daily life, better prices, and fewer crowds. San Miguel is prettier but more expensive; Querétaro is more practical but equally charming."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Querétaro safe?",
      "answer": "Querétaro is one of Mexico's safest cities, consistently ranking high in quality-of-life surveys. The historic center is very safe day and night.

    },
    {
      "question": "What about the wine country?",
      "answer": "Querétaro's wine region is Mexico's second-largest and produces excellent wines, especially sparkling. Over 30 wineries are within an hour of the city. Freixenet Mexico makes world-class sparkling wine. Most wineries offer tastings and tours. Combine with artisanal cheese for a perfect day."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend?",
      "answer": "2-3 days covers the city and one day trip (wine route or Bernal). A week allows time to explore Sierra Gorda and fully enjoy the restaurant scene. Many travelers extend their stay after discovering how livable the city is."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get there from Mexico City?",
      "answer": "Direct buses run hourly from Mexico City's Terminal Norte (2-2.5 hours, ~$20). The Querétaro airport (QRO) has some direct flights but CDMX is often more convenient. Driving is easy on the modern toll highway (2 hours)."
