This artsy community offers excellent restaurants, sea turtle conservation programs, yoga and wellness, and a beautiful wide beach—all with fewer tourists than neighboring Sayulita. It's the beach town for travelers seeking substance over scene.",
  "introduction": "<p>San Pancho—officially San Francisco, but everyone uses the nickname—sits just ten minutes north of Sayulita but feels worlds apart. Where Sayulita has embraced party tourism, San Pancho has cultivated a quieter, more artistic identity. It's a community of artists, healers, conservationists, and expats drawn to its grounded vibe.</p><p>The single main street, Avenida Tercer Mundo, is lined with excellent restaurants, yoga studios, art galleries, and boutiques selling local crafts. The wide golden beach is backed by jungle-covered hills, with good waves for surfers and calm sections for swimming. Sea turtles nest here from June to December, protected by community conservation programs.</p><p>What makes San Pancho special is its community spirit. This was the first 'polo town' of Luis Echeverría's development program, and that collectivist legacy shows in the cultural center, community events, and general sense that this place has soul. It's the beach town for travelers who've outgrown the party scene.</p>",
