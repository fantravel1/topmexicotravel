  "featured_snippet_intro": "Guanajuato is Mexico's most dramatically beautiful colonial city—a UNESCO World Heritage gem nestled in a narrow ravine where colorful houses cascade down hillsides, underground streets wind through old mine tunnels, and callejoneadas (musical walking tours) fill the night with song. This vibrant university town delivers visual wonder at every turn.",
  "introduction": "<p>Founded in 1559 after silver was discovered in the surrounding hills, Guanajuato became one of the world's most productive silver mining regions, funding ornate churches and grand theaters. When the mines declined, the city preserved its colonial character almost perfectly. Today, the winding streets (some running underground through former mine tunnels and a riverbed), colorful facades, and elaborate plazas create one of Mexico's most photogenic urban landscapes.</p><p>Home to the prestigious University of Guanajuato, the city pulses with youthful energy. Students and visitors gather in the jardín principal, wander the underground streets, and join the callejoneadas—traditional musical processions through the alleys led by estudiantinas (student troubadours).</p><p>The city is also famous for the Mummy Museum, displaying naturally mummified bodies from the 19th century, and the annual Festival Cervantino, Latin America's largest performing arts festival. Guanajuato pairs perfectly with nearby San Miguel de Allende for an unforgettable colonial Mexico experience.</p>",

    {
      "question": "What is a callejoneada?",
      "answer": "A callejoneada is a traditional musical walking tour through Guanajuato's narrow alleys (callejones) led by estudiantinas—students in colonial-era dress playing music and telling romantic stories. Participants carry wine or drinks in ceramic jugs. Tours leave from the jardín principal most nights and last 2-3 hours. It's a quintessential Guanajuato experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "The nearest airport is León/Bajío (BJX), about 45 minutes away. From there, take a taxi or transfer to the city. Luxury buses from Mexico City (5 hours) or Guadalajara (4 hours) are also popular. Many visitors combine Guanajuato with San Miguel de Allende, about 1.5 hours away."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Guanajuato walkable?",
      "answer": "Guanajuato's centro is very walkable but hilly—wear comfortable shoes. The underground streets require navigation but are fascinating to explore. Taxis are available for outlying sights like the Mummy Museum. The funicular to Pípila saves a steep climb. Many streets are pedestrian-only, which makes walking pleasant."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the Festival Cervantino?",
      "answer": "The Festival Internacional Cervantino, Latin America's largest performing arts festival, takes place over three weeks in October. The city fills with performances, art, and visitors from around the world. Book accommodation months in advance if visiting during the festival, or enjoy the festive spillover atmosphere in nearby San Miguel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit the Guanajuato mummies?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Museo de las Momias displays over 100 naturally mummified bodies from the 19th century, preserved by the area's unique dry climate and mineral-rich soil. It's fascinating but not for the squeamish—children's mummies are included. Located on the outskirts of centro, easily reached by taxi."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal for Guanajuato: wandering the colorful streets, visiting museums and viewpoints, exploring the underground streets, and experiencing a callejoneada. Add an extra day to combine with San Miguel de Allende (1.5 hours away) or explore the surrounding mining villages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the underground streets in Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "Guanajuato's underground streets were created from old mine tunnels and by covering the riverbed that once ran through the city center. Today, traffic flows through these tunnels beneath the city while pedestrians walk above. It's a unique urban feature found nowhere else in Mexico."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Guanajuato safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Guanajuato is generally considered safe for tourists. The historic center is walkable day and night, with a strong police presence especially during festivals. Use normal precautions, be aware of your surroundings, and avoid isolated areas late at night. The university atmosphere keeps the city lively and relatively safe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best viewpoint in Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "The Pípila monument offers the best panoramic view of the colorful city. Take the funicular or walk up through winding alleys. Sunset is particularly beautiful when the city glows golden. There are cafés at the top for drinks with a view. Come at night when the city sparkles below."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I eat in Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "Try enchiladas mineras (local-style enchiladas), gorditas from Mercado Hidalgo, local mezcal, and traditional Mexican dishes. The market is excellent for cheap, authentic food. For upscale dining, try Mestizo or Truco 7. Don't miss the unusual ice cream flavors in Dolores Hidalgo nearby."

  "getting_there": "León/Bajío International Airport (BJX) is the nearest airport, about 45 minutes away, with flights from the US and Mexico City. Luxury buses (ETN, Primera Plus) connect Guanajuato to Mexico City (5 hours) and Guadalajara (4 hours). From San Miguel de Allende, it's a 1.5-hour drive or bus ride.",
  "getting_around": "Guanajuato's centro is pedestrian-friendly but hilly. Many streets are pedestrian-only, making walking pleasant. The underground streets handle most vehicular traffic. Taxis are available for outlying attractions like the Mummy Museum. The Pípila funicular saves a steep climb. Parking in centro is very limited—most visitors park outside and walk.",
  "safety_info": "Guanajuato is generally safe for tourists, especially the centro area. The university presence keeps the city lively. Use normal precautions: don't flash valuables, be aware of your surroundings at night, and use official taxis. During Festival Cervantino, crowds can be overwhelming but security is heightened.",
