    "snippet": "Guanajuato is Mexico's most dramatically beautiful colonial city—a UNESCO World Heritage gem nestled in a narrow ravine where colorful houses cascade down hillsides, underground streets wind through old mine tunnels, and callejoneadas (musical walking tours) fill the night with song. This vibrant university town delivers visual wonder at every turn.",
    "full": "Founded in 1559 after silver was discovered in the surrounding hills, Guanajuato became one of the world's most productive silver mining regions, funding ornate churches and grand theaters. When the mines declined, the city preserved its colonial character almost perfectly. Today, the winding streets (some running underground through former mine tunnels and a riverbed), colorful facades, and elaborate plazas create one of Mexico's most photogenic urban landscapes.\n\nHome to the prestigious University of Guanajuato, the city pulses with youthful energy. Students and visitors gather in the jardín principal, wander the underground streets, and join the callejoneadas—traditional musical processions through the alleys led by estudiantinas (student troubadours). The city is also famous for the Mummy Museum, displaying naturally mummified bodies from the 19th century, and the annual Festival Cervantino, Latin America's largest performing arts festival. Guanajuato pairs perfectly with nearby San Miguel de Allende for an unforgettable colonial Mexico experience."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is a callejoneada?",
      "answer": "A callejoneada is a traditional walking tour through Guanajuato's narrow alleys (callejones) led by estudiantinas—students in colonial-era dress playing music and telling stories. Participants carry wine or drinks in ceramic jugs. Tours leave from the jardín principal most nights and last 2-3 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "The nearest airport is León/Bajío (BJX), about 45 minutes away. From there, take a taxi or transfer to the city. Luxury buses from Mexico City (5 hours) or Guadalajara (4 hours) are also popular. Many visitors combine Guanajuato with San Miguel de Allende, about 1.5 hours away."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Guanajuato walkable?",
      "answer": "Guanajuato's centro is very walkable but hilly—wear comfortable shoes. The underground streets require navigation. Taxis are available for outlying sights like the Mummy Museum. The funicular to Pípila saves a steep climb. Many streets are pedestrian-only."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the Festival Cervantino?",
      "answer": "The Festival Internacional Cervantino, Latin America's largest performing arts festival, takes place over three weeks in October. The city fills with performances, art, and visitors. Book accommodation months in advance, or enjoy the festive spillover atmosphere in nearby San Miguel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit the Guanajuato mummies?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Museo de las Momias displays over 100 naturally mummified bodies from the 19th century, preserved by the area's dry climate. It's fascinating but not for the squeamish—children's mummies are included. Located on the outskirts of centro, easily reached by taxi."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Guanajuato?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal for Guanajuato: wandering the colorful streets, visiting museums and viewpoints, and experiencing a callejoneada. Add an extra day to combine with San Miguel de Allende (1.5 hours away) or explore the surrounding mining villages."
