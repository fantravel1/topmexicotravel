  "introduction": "<p>The Riviera Maya is Mexico's most celebrated beach destination, a 100-mile stretch of Caribbean coastline that encompasses everything from the party atmosphere of Cancún to the bohemian vibes of Tulum. This is where ancient Mayan civilization meets modern resort luxury, where you can swim in underground cenotes in the morning and explore pyramid ruins in the afternoon.</p><p>What makes the Riviera Maya unique is its extraordinary diversity. The world's second-largest barrier reef lies just offshore, offering some of the planet's best snorkeling and diving. Thousands of cenotes—natural sinkholes filled with crystal-clear water—dot the jungle landscape, connected by the world's largest underwater cave system. And the legacy of the ancient Maya is everywhere, from the clifftop ruins of Tulum to the grand city of Cobá deep in the jungle.</p><p>Whether you're seeking an all-inclusive family resort, a romantic adults-only escape, adventure activities, or authentic Mexican culture, the Riviera Maya delivers. The region has something for every traveler and every budget, making it Mexico's most versatile vacation destination.</p>",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Cancún and the Riviera Maya?",
      "answer": "Cancún is a specific city with its famous Hotel Zone on a narrow strip. The Riviera Maya is the 100-mile coastal stretch from Cancún south to Tulum, including Playa del Carmen, Puerto Morelos, Akumal, and Tulum. Cancún has more high-rise resorts and nightlife; the Riviera Maya offers more variety from boutique to all-inclusive, plus easier access to cenotes and ruins."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit the Riviera Maya?",
      "answer": "December to April offers the best weather with low humidity, minimal rain, and comfortable temperatures. May and November are good shoulder seasons with fewer crowds and good prices. Hurricane season runs June through November, with September and October having the highest risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around the Riviera Maya?",
      "answer": "Colectivos (shared vans) run frequently between towns for $2-5 USD and are safe and efficient. Taxis and Uber work in main towns. Renting a car is best for exploring cenotes and ruins independently. Most all-inclusive guests stay at their resort, but renting a car for a day or two is recommended for exploration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Riviera Maya safe?",
      "answer": "The tourist corridor is very safe. Millions visit annually without incident. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables on the beach, use hotel safes, and stick to well-lit areas at night. The entire coast is well-patrolled. Petty theft is the main concern, not violent crime."
    },
    {
      "question": "All-inclusive or independent hotels?",
      "answer": "All-inclusives are great for families and those wanting zero hassle—everything's covered. Independent hotels (common in Tulum and Playa) offer more flexibility to explore local restaurants and nightlife. Many travelers do a mix: a few nights at an all-inclusive, then move to a boutique hotel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cenotes should I visit?",
      "answer": "Gran Cenote near Tulum is perfect for beginners with easy access and turtles. Dos Ojos offers incredible cave snorkeling and diving. Cenote Azul is great for families with shallow areas. Cenote Suytun has dramatic light beams but gets crowded. Rent a car to visit multiple cenotes in a day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see Mayan ruins?",
      "answer": "Yes! Tulum ruins are the most accessible, perched on cliffs above the beach. Cobá has the tallest climbable pyramid. Chichén Itzá is a day trip but worth it. Lesser-known sites like Ek Balam and Muyil offer ruins without crowds. Most resorts offer guided tours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend?",
      "answer": "7 days allows time for beaches, 2-3 cenotes, ruins, and relaxation. 10-14 days lets you explore multiple towns along the coast. Even 4-5 days can cover the highlights if you're efficient. For a deep dive into cenotes and ruins, plan 10+ days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the water safe to drink?",
      "answer": "No, don't drink tap water. All hotels provide purified water, and bottled water is cheap everywhere. Ice in restaurants is safe (made from purified water). Most resorts have filtered water dispensers. Avoid swallowing cenote water, though it looks pristine."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about seaweed (sargassum)?",
      "answer": "Sargassum seaweed has affected Caribbean beaches, especially from May to October. Resorts clean their beaches daily, but conditions vary. Check recent reports before booking. The west-facing beaches of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres are less affected."

  "getting_there": "Cancún International Airport (CUN) is the main gateway, with direct flights from most major US and Canadian cities, plus European destinations. The Riviera Maya stretches from 20 minutes (Puerto Morelos) to 2 hours (Tulum) south of the airport. Most hotels offer airport transfers, or use ADO bus, shared shuttles, or rental cars.",
  "getting_around": "Colectivo vans run constantly between towns along Highway 307 for $2-5 USD. Taxis work for short trips. Uber operates in Cancún and Playa del Carmen. Rental cars are ideal for cenote-hopping and ruins visits. Most all-inclusive guests don't need transportation unless venturing out.",
  "safety_info": "The Riviera Maya is one of Mexico's safest tourist areas. Millions visit annually without incident. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables unattended on beaches, use hotel safes, and be aware of your surroundings at night. The tourist corridor is well-patrolled. Avoid isolated areas after dark.",
