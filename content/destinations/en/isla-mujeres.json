    "snippet": "Isla Mujeres is a laid-back Caribbean island just 20 minutes by ferry from Cancún—but a world away in atmosphere. This petite 7km-long paradise offers colorful streets, golf cart exploration, pristine Playa Norte beach, world-famous whale shark encounters, and the relaxed vibe that mainland resorts often lack.",
    "full": "Once a sacred site dedicated to the Maya goddess Ixchel, Isla Mujeres (Island of Women) has evolved from a fishing village into one of Mexico's most charming island escapes. Unlike the mega-resort development of Cancún's Hotel Zone visible across the water, Isla Mujeres has preserved its small-town feel with pedestrian streets, colorful Caribbean architecture, and a community of locals who still fish these waters.\n\nThe island is small enough to explore entirely by golf cart in a few hours, from the famous white sand of Playa Norte (consistently rated among Mexico's best beaches) to the scenic southern tip at Punta Sur with its clifftop sculpture garden. Between May and September, Isla Mujeres becomes ground zero for swimming with whale sharks—the largest fish in the sea—in an ethical, regulated encounter. Whether you're visiting for a day from Cancún or settling in for a week, Isla Mujeres delivers Caribbean magic without the crowds, at prices that won't break the bank."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Isla Mujeres from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Ultramar ferries run every 30 minutes from Puerto Juárez (downtown Cancún, cheapest) and the Hotel Zone (more convenient but pricier). The ride takes about 20 minutes and costs $15-20 USD round trip. No reservation needed—just show up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Isla Mujeres a good day trip from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Yes! A day trip gives you time to enjoy Playa Norte, golf cart around the island, explore downtown, and catch sunset drinks before the last ferry. However, staying overnight lets you experience the island's magic after the day-trippers leave."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I rent a golf cart on Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "Renting a golf cart is the quintessential Isla Mujeres experience and the best way to explore. Rates are around $40-60 USD for a full day. The island is small enough to see everything in 2-3 hours. Walking and biking are alternatives for the active."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is whale shark season in Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "Whale shark season runs May through September, with peak season June-August. Tours depart early morning and include snorkeling with these gentle giants. Book with certified operators who follow ethical guidelines (limited swimmers, no touching)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Isla Mujeres safe?",
      "answer": "Isla Mujeres is very safe—one of the safest places in Mexico. The small island community, tourism-dependent economy, and limited access make crime rare. Use normal precautions: secure valuables, don't flaunt expensive items."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend on Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal to fully enjoy the island's pace: beach time at Playa Norte, golf cart exploration, snorkeling or diving, and leisurely dining. Day-trippers see the highlights but miss the magic of sunset and early morning beach time."
