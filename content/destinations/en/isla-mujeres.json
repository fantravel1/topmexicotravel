    "snippet": "Isla Mujeres is a laid-back Caribbean island just 20 minutes by ferry from Cancún—but a world away in atmosphere. This petite 7km-long paradise offers colorful streets, golf cart exploration, pristine Playa Norte beach, world-famous whale shark encounters, and the relaxed vibe that mainland resorts often lack.",
    "full": "Once a sacred site dedicated to the Maya goddess Ixchel, Isla Mujeres (Island of Women) has evolved from a fishing village into one of Mexico's most charming island escapes. Unlike the mega-resort development of Cancún's Hotel Zone visible across the water, Isla Mujeres has preserved its small-town feel with pedestrian streets, colorful Caribbean architecture, and a community of locals who still fish these waters.\n\nThe island is small enough to explore entirely by golf cart in a few hours, from the famous white sand of Playa Norte (consistently rated among Mexico's best beaches) to the scenic southern tip at Punta Sur with its clifftop sculpture garden. Between May and September, Isla Mujeres becomes ground zero for swimming with whale sharks—the largest fish in the sea—in an ethical, regulated encounter. Whether you're visiting for a day from Cancún or settling in for a week, Isla Mujeres delivers Caribbean magic without the crowds, at prices that won't break the bank."

The main ferry terminal is Puerto Juárez (cheapest, closest to downtown Cancún) with additional departures from the Hotel Zone at Gran Puerto (more convenient for resort guests). Round trip costs $15-20 USD. No reservation needed—just show up.",
  "getting_around": "Rent a golf cart ($40-60/day) for the quintessential island experience. The island is also walkable, especially downtown and Playa Norte. Taxis are available. Bikes can be rented but the heat makes golf carts more pleasant. Everything is close—the island is only 7km long.",
  "safety_info": "Isla Mujeres is extremely safe—one of the safest places in Mexico. The small island community depends on tourism and crime is rare. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables unattended on the beach, avoid walking alone in dark areas late at night. The main safety concerns are sunburn and golf cart accidents.",

      "question": "How do I get to Isla Mujeres from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Ultramar ferries run every 30 minutes from Puerto Juárez (downtown Cancún, cheapest at $15-18 USD round trip) and the Hotel Zone's Gran Puerto terminal (more convenient but pricier). The ride takes about 20 minutes. No reservation needed—just show up at the terminal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Isla Mujeres a good day trip from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Yes! A day trip gives you time to enjoy Playa Norte, golf cart around the island, explore downtown, and catch sunset drinks before the last ferry (around 11:30pm). However, staying overnight lets you experience the island's magic after day-trippers leave—the sunset and morning hours are special."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I rent a golf cart on Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "Renting a golf cart is the quintessential Isla Mujeres experience and the best way to explore. Rates run $40-60 USD for a full day. The island is small enough to see everything in 2-3 hours by cart. Rent from downtown shops rather than at the ferry for better prices."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is whale shark season in Isla Mujeres?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Isla Mujeres safe?",
      "answer": "Isla Mujeres is very safe—one of the safest places in Mexico. The small island community relies on tourism, and crime is extremely rare. Use normal precautions with valuables on the beach. The main 'dangers' are sunburn and the occasional golf cart accident."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend on Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal to fully enjoy the island's pace: beach time at Playa Norte, golf cart exploration, snorkeling or diving at MUSA, and leisurely dining. Day-trippers see the highlights but miss the magic of sunset at Playa Norte and early morning beach time before crowds arrive."

    {
      "question": "Is Isla Mujeres better than Cancún?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Playa Norte good for swimming?",
      "answer": "Playa Norte is excellent for swimming—calm, warm, impossibly shallow (you can walk far out), with no waves. It's perfect for floating, wading, and non-swimmers. The calm conditions are due to the north-facing orientation protected from prevailing winds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use credit cards on Isla Mujeres?",
      "answer": "Many restaurants and shops accept credit cards, but smaller establishments, taxis, and street vendors are cash-only. ATMs are available downtown but can have high fees. Bring a mix of pesos and cards. Some places accept US dollars at unfavorable rates."
