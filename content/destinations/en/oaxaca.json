This colonial gem in the mountains of southern Mexico offers travelers the most authentic Mexican experience.",
  "introduction": "<p>Oaxaca (pronounced wa-HA-ka) is the capital of Mexico's most ethnically diverse state, home to 16 distinct indigenous groups including the Zapotec and Mixtec peoples. This diversity manifests in an extraordinarily rich cultural landscape: from the seven moles (complex sauces) that define Oaxacan cuisine to the black pottery of San Bartolo Coyotepec and the fantastical alebrijes of Arrazola.</p><p>The city's colonial center, built by the Spanish over an ancient Zapotec settlement, has been carefully preserved with its iconic green cantera stone architecture, most dramatically displayed in the Baroque Santo Domingo church. Beyond the city, the Central Valleys are dotted with craft villages, mezcal distilleries (palenques), and the remarkable pre-Columbian ruins of Monte Albán, perched 400 meters above the valley floor.</p><p>Oaxaca is also ground zero for mezcal, the smoky agave spirit experiencing a global renaissance, with hundreds of small-batch producers welcoming visitors. The food scene has earned international acclaim, with traditional markets, acclaimed restaurants, and cooking schools attracting food lovers from around the world. If you're seeking the soul of Mexico, you'll find it in Oaxaca.</p>",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What food is Oaxaca known for?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca is famous for its seven moles (complex sauces), especially mole negro and coloradito. Other specialties include tlayudas (Oaxacan pizza), tasajo (dried beef), chapulines (grasshoppers), quesillo (Oaxacan string cheese), mezcal, and artisanal chocolate. Oaxacan cuisine is widely considered Mexico's best and most diverse."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "October to April offers dry, pleasant weather. Late October/early November brings spectacular Día de los Muertos celebrations in surrounding villages. July features the Guelaguetza, the state's biggest cultural festival. The rainy season (May-September) brings afternoon showers but fewer tourists and lower prices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca has an international airport (OAX) with flights from Mexico City, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Alternatively, fly to Mexico City and take a 6-7 hour luxury ADO bus through the mountains. The bus ride is scenic but winding—those prone to motion sickness may prefer flying."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Oaxaca safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca city is considered one of Mexico's safest destinations. The historic center is very walkable day and night. Use normal precautions with valuables, be aware of occasional political protests (typically peaceful), and avoid isolated areas late at night. The Central Valleys are equally safe."

      "question": "What is the Guelaguetza festival?",
      "answer": "The Guelaguetza is Oaxaca's biggest cultural celebration, held on the last two Mondays of July. Indigenous groups from across the state perform traditional dances in colorful costumes at a hillside amphitheater. The word means 'reciprocal exchange of gifts.' Book accommodation 2-3 months in advance."

    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Plan for at least 5-7 days: 2-3 days for the city (markets, museums, food, cooking class), 1 day for Monte Albán, 1-2 days for day trips (mezcal route, artisan villages, Hierve el Agua). Food and mezcal enthusiasts could easily spend two weeks exploring the valleys."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is mezcal and how is it different from tequila?",
      "answer": "Mezcal is a spirit made from any agave plant, traditionally roasted in earthen pits giving it a smoky flavor. Tequila is technically a type of mezcal, but made only from blue agave in specific regions. Oaxaca produces over 90% of Mexico's mezcal, with hundreds of small-batch artisanal producers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I book a tour or explore independently?",
      "answer": "For Monte Albán, day trips to craft villages, and mezcal tours, guided tours provide valuable context and convenient transportation. The city center is easy to explore independently on foot. For a deeper experience, consider a multi-day food or mezcal tour with expert guides."
    },
    {
      "question": "What souvenirs should I buy in Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca is famous for artisan crafts: black pottery (barro negro), colorful alebrijes (carved wooden creatures), handwoven wool rugs from Teotitlán, embroidered textiles, artisanal mezcal, and Oaxacan chocolate. Buy directly from artisan workshops for best prices and to support families."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the altitude in Oaxaca and does it affect visitors?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca sits at 1,550 meters (5,085 feet), similar to Denver. Most visitors don't experience altitude effects, but stay hydrated, limit alcohol the first day, and take it easy if you feel lightheaded. The mild climate is comfortable year-round thanks to the elevation."

  "getting_there": "Oaxaca International Airport (OAX) has direct flights from Mexico City (1 hour), Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The airport is 15 minutes from downtown. Alternatively, first-class ADO buses connect Oaxaca to Mexico City (6-7 hours, $40-50 USD) and Puebla (4.5 hours). The mountain highway is scenic but winding.",
  "getting_around": "The historic center is very walkable. Taxis are inexpensive ($2-3 USD within center) and abundant. For day trips, hire a driver or join organized tours—driving in the mountains requires experience with winding roads. Colectivo vans serve the Central Valleys but can be confusing for non-Spanish speakers.",
  "safety_info": "Oaxaca is one of Mexico's safest tourist destinations. The historic center is safe to walk day and night. Use normal precautions: avoid displaying expensive jewelry, use ATMs inside banks, and be aware of your surroundings. Occasional political demonstrations occur on the Zócalo—they're usually peaceful but avoid large crowds.",
