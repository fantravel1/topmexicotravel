    "snippet": "Oaxaca is Mexico's cultural capital—a UNESCO World Heritage city where indigenous traditions flourish, artisans create world-renowned crafts, mezcal flows freely, and the food scene rivals any city on earth. Nestled in a mountain valley surrounded by Zapotec ruins, this colonial gem offers travelers an authentic, deeply Mexican experience.",
    "full": "Oaxaca (pronounced wa-HA-ka) is the capital of Mexico's most ethnically diverse state, home to 16 distinct indigenous groups including the Zapotec and Mixtec peoples. This diversity manifests in an extraordinarily rich cultural landscape: from the seven moles (complex sauces) that define Oaxacan cuisine to the black pottery of San Bartolo Coyotepec and the fantastical alebrijes of Arrazola.\n\nThe city's colonial center, built by the Spanish over an ancient Zapotec settlement, has been carefully preserved with its iconic green cantera stone architecture, most dramatically displayed in the Baroque Santo Domingo church. Beyond the city, the Central Valleys are dotted with craft villages, mezcal distilleries (palenques), and the remarkable pre-Columbian ruins of Monte Albán, perched 400 meters above the valley floor. Oaxaca is also ground zero for mezcal, the smoky agave spirit experiencing a global renaissance, with hundreds of small-batch producers welcoming visitors. If you're seeking the soul of Mexico, you'll find it in Oaxaca."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What food is Oaxaca known for?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca is famous for its seven moles (complex sauces), especially negro and coloradito. Other specialties include tlayudas (Oaxacan pizza), tasajo (dried beef), chapulines (grasshoppers), Oaxacan cheese (quesillo), chocolate, and mezcal. The food scene is considered Mexico's best."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "October to April offers dry, pleasant weather. Late October/early November brings the spectacular Día de los Muertos celebrations. July's Guelaguetza festival is the state's biggest cultural event. The rainy season (May-September) brings afternoon showers but fewer tourists."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca has a small international airport (OAX) with flights from Mexico City, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Alternatively, fly to Mexico City and take a 6-7 hour luxury bus (ADO), or the scenic but long drive through the mountains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Oaxaca safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca city is considered one of Mexico's safest destinations for tourists. The historic center is very walkable day and night. Use normal precautions, and be aware of occasional political protests (typically peaceful). The surrounding valleys are equally safe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Guelaguetza festival?",
      "answer": "The Guelaguetza is Oaxaca's biggest cultural celebration, held on the last two Mondays of July. Indigenous groups from across the state perform traditional dances in colorful costumes at a hillside amphitheater. Book accommodation months in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Plan for at least 4-5 days: 2 days for the city (markets, museums, food), 1 day for Monte Albán, and 1-2 days for day trips (mezcal route, artisan villages, Hierve el Agua). Food and mezcal enthusiasts could easily spend a week or more."
