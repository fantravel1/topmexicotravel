    "snippet": "Huatulco is Mexico's model sustainable beach destination—nine pristine bays with 36 beaches set against the lush Sierra Madre Sur mountains, all developed with ecological preservation in mind. This Oaxacan coastal gem offers excellent snorkeling, waterfalls, authentic Mexican culture, and resort comfort without the overdevelopment or crowds of northern destinations.",
    "full": "Developed by the Mexican government in the 1980s as a planned resort destination, Huatulco learned from the mistakes of Cancún. The result is a unique place where luxury hotels coexist with protected national park land, where beaches remain uncrowded, and where the local Oaxacan culture hasn't been overwhelmed by tourism. The area was certified as a Green Globe destination for sustainable tourism—a distinction it takes seriously.\n\nThe nine bays (bahías) offer distinct experiences: Santa Cruz has the main marina and town life, Tangolunda hosts the large resorts, Chahué has a growing restaurant scene, and undeveloped bays like Cacaluta and San Agustín provide pristine escapes. Beyond the beaches, the surrounding sierra offers waterfalls, coffee plantations, and Zapotec communities. The waters here feature some of Mexico's best snorkeling and diving, with healthy reefs and abundant marine life. Huatulco attracts those seeking quality beach vacation with Oaxacan food, genuine Mexican atmosphere, and nature that hasn't been sacrificed to development."
