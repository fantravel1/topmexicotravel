While Los Cabos caters to resorts and nightlife, La Paz draws nature lovers, divers, and travelers seeking genuine Mexican culture. The Sea of Cortez—which Jacques Cousteau called 'the world's aquarium'—is the star attraction.</p><p>The city's beautiful malecón stretches for miles along the bay, lined with sculptures, restaurants, and sunset views. The historic center has colonial architecture, excellent seafood, and a relaxed pace. But most visitors come for the water: whale shark encounters, sea lion colonies, pristine island beaches, and some of the best diving in Mexico.</p><p>Espíritu Santo Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offers snorkeling with playful sea lions, kayaking through mangroves, and camping on deserted beaches. From January to March, whale sharks gather in the bay for unforgettable snorkeling encounters.</p>",
