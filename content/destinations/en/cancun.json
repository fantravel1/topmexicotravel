Located on the Yucatán Peninsula, this tropical paradise offers the perfect blend of relaxation, adventure, and ancient Mayan culture, attracting over 6 million visitors annually.",
    "full": "Rising from the mangroves of the Yucatán Peninsula in the 1970s, Cancún has transformed into one of the world's premier vacation destinations. The city is divided into two distinct areas: the Hotel Zone (Zona Hotelera), a 23-kilometer strip of land shaped like the number 7 that's home to most resorts and beaches, and Downtown Cancún (El Centro), where locals live and authentic Mexican culture thrives.\n\nCancún attracts over 6 million visitors annually with its year-round tropical climate, crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and diving, and easy access to some of Mexico's most impressive archaeological sites. Whether you're seeking an all-inclusive resort experience, underwater adventures in the Great Mesoamerican Reef, or day trips to Chichén Itzá, Cancún delivers an unforgettable Mexican Caribbean vacation.\n\nWhat sets Cancún apart is its versatility. Families love the calm waters of Playa Langosta and the adventure parks. Couples find romance in sunset sailing and spa retreats. Party-goers flock to the legendary nightclubs of the Hotel Zone. And culture enthusiasts use Cancún as a base to explore ancient Mayan cities, mystical cenotes, and colonial towns throughout the Yucatán."
