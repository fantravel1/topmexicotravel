    "snippet": "Cozumel is Mexico's largest Caribbean island and one of the world's top diving destinations. Jacques Cousteau put this paradise on the map in 1961, and divers have been flocking ever since to explore the spectacular coral formations of Palancar and Santa Rosa reefs. Beyond diving, the island offers pristine beaches, laid-back vibes, and easy access from the Riviera Maya.",
    "full": "Located 19 kilometers off the coast of Playa del Carmen, Cozumel is the antidote to the mainland's tourist bustle. While cruise ships bring day-trippers to the western shore, most of the island remains undeveloped, with wild eastern beaches, mangrove lagoons, and the ancient Maya site of San Gervasio. The small downtown of San Miguel offers a relaxed pace, colorful streets, and authentic Mexican atmosphere.\n\nThe underwater world is Cozumel's crown jewel. The island sits within the Mesoamerican Reef system, the world's second-largest barrier reef, and its protected marine park ensures pristine conditions. Visibility regularly exceeds 30 meters, and the drift diving along vertical walls teeming with marine life is legendary. Even snorkelers can experience world-class reef systems at several beach clubs. Whether you're a certified diver chasing eagle rays through swim-throughs or a beach lover seeking Caribbean perfection, Cozumel delivers an island escape at its finest."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Cozumel?",
      "answer": "The easiest way is by ferry from Playa del Carmen (30 minutes, $20 USD round trip, frequent departures). Cozumel also has its own international airport (CZM) with direct flights from US cities. From Cancún, take transportation to Playa del Carmen then the ferry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be a certified diver to enjoy Cozumel?",
      "answer": "No! Cozumel offers excellent snorkeling at beach parks and from boats. Non-divers can try 'Discover Scuba' introductory dives. The clarity and reef health mean snorkelers see nearly as much as divers at shallow sites. Glass-bottom boats are also available."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cozumel better than Cancún for diving?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cozumel is generally considered far superior for diving due to better visibility (30-40m), protected marine park status, healthier coral, and world-famous sites like Palancar and Santa Rosa. The diving infrastructure is also more established and dive-focused."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to dive in Cozumel?",
      "answer": "March to June offers the best conditions: calm seas, excellent visibility, and warm water. December-February can have occasional norte (north wind) days. Hurricane season (September-November) brings some risk. Water temperature is warm (26-29°C) year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cozumel safe?",
      "answer": "Cozumel is very safe—one of Mexico's safest destinations. The small island has a tight-knit community, tourism-dependent economy, and low crime. Normal precautions apply: don't leave valuables unattended on beaches, use hotel safes, and avoid riding motorbikes without experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you swim at Cozumel beaches?",
      "answer": "The calm western shore has excellent swimming beaches, especially at beach clubs like Playa Mia, Paradise Beach, and Mr. Sanchos. The wild eastern coast has powerful waves and currents—beautiful but dangerous for swimming. Always check local conditions."
