  "introduction": {
    "snippet": "Cozumel is Mexico's largest Caribbean island and one of the world's top diving destinations. Jacques Cousteau put this paradise on the map in 1961, and divers have been flocking ever since to explore the spectacular coral formations of Palancar and Santa Rosa reefs. Beyond diving, the island offers pristine beaches, laid-back vibes, and easy access from the Riviera Maya.",
    "full": "Located 19 kilometers off the coast of Playa del Carmen, Cozumel is the antidote to the mainland's tourist bustle. While cruise ships bring day-trippers to the western shore, most of the island remains undeveloped, with wild eastern beaches, mangrove lagoons, and the ancient Maya site of San Gervasio. The small downtown of San Miguel offers a relaxed pace, colorful streets, and authentic Mexican atmosphere.\n\nThe underwater world is Cozumel's crown jewel. The island sits within the Mesoamerican Reef system, the world's second-largest barrier reef, and its protected marine park ensures pristine conditions. Visibility regularly exceeds 30 meters, and the drift diving along vertical walls teeming with marine life is legendary. Even snorkelers can experience world-class reef systems at several beach clubs. Whether you're a certified diver chasing eagle rays through swim-throughs or a beach lover seeking Caribbean perfection, Cozumel delivers an island escape at its finest."

  "getting_there": "Cozumel has its own international airport (CZM) with direct flights from US cities including Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Charlotte. The more common route is flying into Cancún (CUN) and taking ground transportation to Playa del Carmen (1 hour), then the ferry to Cozumel (30 minutes, $18-20 USD round trip, ferries every 30 minutes from 6am-11pm).",
  "getting_around": "Rent a car, Jeep, or scooter to explore the island—this is the best way to see the east coast and reach Punta Sur. Taxis are available but unmetered; agree on price before riding. The downtown area is walkable. For diving, most operators provide hotel pickup.",
  "safety_info": "Cozumel is very safe—one of Mexico's safest destinations. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables unattended on beaches, use hotel safes, and avoid riding scooters without experience (many tourist injuries are scooter accidents). The east coast has dangerous currents—swim only at designated safe beaches like Chen Rio.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Cozumel from Cancún?",
      "answer": "From Cancún airport, take an ADO bus or private transfer to Playa del Carmen (about 1 hour, $12-50 USD depending on option). Then take the ferry from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel (30 minutes, $18-20 USD round trip). Ferries depart every 30 minutes from early morning to 11pm. Alternatively, Cozumel has direct flights from some US cities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be a certified diver to enjoy Cozumel?",
      "answer": "No! Cozumel offers excellent snorkeling at beach parks like Chankanaab and on boat tours to Palancar and El Cielo. Non-divers can try 'Discover Scuba' introductory dives with an instructor. The incredible visibility (30-40m) means snorkelers see nearly as much as divers at shallow reef sections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cozumel better than Cancún for diving?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Cozumel is considered far superior for diving due to better visibility (30-40m vs 15-20m), protected marine park status ensuring healthy coral, world-famous drift diving sites (Palancar, Santa Rosa, Columbia), and more established dive infrastructure. Serious divers choose Cozumel; Cancún is better for partying."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to dive in Cozumel?",
      "answer": "March to June offers optimal conditions: calm seas, excellent visibility, and warm water (27-29°C). December-February can have occasional norte (north wind) days that cancel boat trips. Hurricane season (September-November) brings some risk, though most storms miss the island. Diving is possible year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cozumel safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cozumel is very safe—one of Mexico's safest destinations. The small island has a tight-knit community, tourism-dependent economy, and low crime rate. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables unattended, use hotel safes, avoid riding scooters without experience, and be cautious of currents when swimming on the east coast."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you swim at Cozumel beaches?",
      "answer": "Yes, but location matters. The calm western shore has excellent swimming beaches at beach clubs like Playa Mia, Paradise Beach, and Chankanaab. The wild eastern coast has powerful waves and dangerous currents—beautiful for scenery but unsafe for swimming except at Chen Rio, which has a protected natural pool."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cozumel crowded with cruise ships?",
      "answer": "Cruise ships dock primarily on the southern coast and passengers tend to stay at beach parks or excursions. Downtown San Miguel and the northern hotel zone remain relatively calm. Check cruise ship schedules online and plan your downtown/beach park visits on non-cruise days for a quieter experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Cozumel?",
      "answer": "3-5 days is ideal. Plan 2-3 days of diving or snorkeling to experience multiple reef systems, one day to explore the island (San Gervasio, east coast, Punta Sur), and time for downtown dining and relaxation. Divers often spend a week to take advantage of unlimited dive packages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I pack for Cozumel?",
      "answer": "Reef-safe sunscreen (regular sunscreen is banned in the marine park), swimsuits, light cover-ups, sandals, snorkeling gear (optional—widely available to rent), dive certification card if diving, and casual evening wear. The dress code is very relaxed. Don't forget seasickness medication if prone to motion sickness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there nightlife in Cozumel?",
      "answer": "Cozumel has a laid-back evening scene rather than clubs. Downtown San Miguel has bars, restaurants with live music, and the famous Wet Wendy's for margaritas. The vibe is relaxed rather than party-oriented. If you want clubbing, visit Playa del Carmen on the mainland."
