  "tagline": "Mexico's powerhouse city where dramatic mountains meet modern ambition and the best carne asada you'll ever taste",
  "featured_snippet_intro": "Monterrey is Mexico's third-largest city and industrial capital, set dramatically against the Sierra Madre mountains. Known for world-class carne asada, adventure sports in nearby canyons, a thriving arts scene, and a work-hard-play-hard culture that feels distinctly different from the rest of Mexico.",
  "introduction": "<p>Monterrey is unlike anywhere else in Mexico. This prosperous industrial metropolis—home to major corporations, top universities, and Mexico's wealthiest citizens—sits dramatically at the foot of the Sierra Madre Oriental, with the iconic Cerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominating the skyline. It's a city of contrasts: glass skyscrapers next to colonial plazas, world-class restaurants serving the country's best beef, and wilderness adventure minutes from downtown.</p><p>Regios (as Monterrey residents are called) have a reputation for being hardworking, entrepreneurial, and fiercely proud of their northern heritage. The cuisine reflects this identity—cabrito (roasted kid goat) and carne asada are practically sacred. The beer culture is legendary (this is where Bohemia, Carta Blanca, and Tecate were born), and the nightlife rivals Mexico City.</p><p>For travelers, Monterrey offers surprising diversity: rappel down waterfalls at Cola de Caballo, hike in Chipinque Ecological Park, explore the stunning MARCO museum, or simply enjoy some of the best food in Mexico. It's a destination for those wanting to see Mexico's modern, ambitious side—and taste what may be the world's greatest grilled meat.</p>",

    {
      "question": "Is Monterrey safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Monterrey has improved significantly and tourist areas (San Pedro, Centro, Barrio Antiguo) are safe. Use Uber instead of street taxis at night. Avoid flashy displays of wealth. The business-oriented culture means less street crime than some Mexican cities. Exercise normal urban precautions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What food must I try?",
      "answer": "Cabrito al pastor (roasted young goat) is the signature dish—don't leave without trying it. Carne asada here is considered Mexico's best, especially arrachera. Other must-tries: machaca (dried beef), frijoles charros (cowboy beans), and local craft beers from the birthplace of Mexican brewing."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit?",
      "answer": "October to April offers pleasant weather (summers are extremely hot, often exceeding 40°C/104°F). March-April and October-November are ideal with comfortable temperatures. Winter can be chilly at night. Avoid summer unless you love intense heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around?",
      "answer": "Uber is the best option—affordable and widely available. The metro covers central areas but isn't extensive. Driving is manageable but traffic is heavy. For day trips (caves, waterfalls), rent a car or book tours. The city is spread out, so plan accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Monterrey just for business travelers?",
      "answer": "No! While it's Mexico's business capital, Monterrey offers excellent museums (MARCO is world-class), incredible food, adventure sports minutes from downtown, and a thriving cultural scene. It's a great destination for foodies, adventure travelers, and those wanting to see modern Mexico."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Monterrey different from other Mexican cities?",
      "answer": "Monterrey feels distinctly 'northern'—more influenced by the US, more business-oriented, and with its own proud regional identity. Regios consider themselves hardworking and entrepreneurial. The food is meat-focused (best beef in Mexico), the beer culture is strong, and the city feels prosperous and modern."
    }
  ],

  "getting_there": "Monterrey International Airport (MTY) has direct flights from major US cities (Houston, Dallas, Chicago, LA) and all Mexican hubs. The airport is 30 minutes from downtown. ADO buses connect to Mexico City (10 hours) and other cities. By car, it's 3 hours from the Texas border at Laredo.",
  "getting_around": "Uber is the best option—reliable and affordable. The metro system covers central areas but isn't comprehensive. Driving is manageable with moderate traffic (compared to Mexico City). For attractions like Chipinque, Huasteca, or waterfalls, rent a car or book tours.",
  "safety_info": "Monterrey has improved significantly and tourist areas are safe. Stick to San Pedro, Centro, Barrio Antiguo, and major attractions. Use Uber instead of street taxis at night. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics. The business-oriented culture means less petty crime than tourist-dependent cities.",
