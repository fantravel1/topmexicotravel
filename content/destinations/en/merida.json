    "snippet": "Mérida is the elegant capital of the Yucatán—a colonial city known as 'La Ciudad Blanca' (The White City) for its beautiful limestone buildings. This sophisticated cultural hub offers incredible Yucatecan cuisine, vibrant plazas with nightly entertainment, and serves as the perfect base for exploring the Mayan wonders of Chichén Itzá, Uxmal, and the region's magical cenotes.",
    "full": "Founded in 1542 on the ruins of the ancient Maya city of T'ho, Mérida became one of the wealthiest cities in the Americas during the henequén (sisal) boom of the late 1800s. The legacy of that era lives on in the grand mansions lining Paseo de Montejo, the tree-lined boulevard modeled after the Champs-Élysées. Today, Mérida is experiencing a renaissance, with restored colonial homes, art galleries, and a food scene that showcases Yucatecan cuisine—considered distinct from the rest of Mexico.\n\nWhat sets Mérida apart is its living culture. Every night of the week, the main plaza and surrounding streets host free entertainment: danzon dancing, traditional jarana music, concerts, and markets. The Mayan heritage remains strong, with indigenous language still spoken and traditional dress worn. Beyond the city, the Yucatán Peninsula offers Mexico's richest archaeological heritage—Chichén Itzá is 1.5 hours away, the elaborate Uxmal even closer—along with cenotes, flamingo reserves, and the Gulf Coast beach of Progreso. Mérida offers a window into a proud, unique corner of Mexico that feels quite unlike anywhere else."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mérida a good base for visiting Chichén Itzá?",
      "answer": "Yes, Mérida is an excellent base for Chichén Itzá (1.5 hours away). You can book tours, rent a car, or take an ADO bus. Staying in Mérida offers more dining, accommodation, and cultural options than staying near the ruins. Go early to avoid crowds and heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Mérida?",
      "answer": "November to March offers cooler, drier weather. Mérida can be extremely hot and humid from April to October, with temperatures exceeding 35°C (95°F). The shoulder season (October-November) offers good weather and fewer tourists. Holy Week is festive but crowded."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around Mérida?",
      "answer": "The centro histórico is very walkable. Use Uber or taxis for longer distances. For day trips to cenotes and ruins, rent a car for flexibility or join organized tours. ADO buses connect to major destinations. Sunday closures of main streets make biking popular."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mérida safe?",
      "answer": "Mérida is consistently ranked as one of Mexico's safest cities. The centro histórico and tourist areas are very safe to walk day and night. Use normal precautions as you would anywhere. The city's safety is a major factor in its growing popularity with visitors and expats."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Mérida?",
      "answer": "Plan for at least 3-4 days: 1-2 days for the city itself (centro, Paseo de Montejo, food scene), 1 day for Chichén Itzá or Uxmal, 1 day for cenotes. Add more time for Celestún flamingos, the Ruta Puuc, or beach time at Progreso. Many visitors stay a week or more."
