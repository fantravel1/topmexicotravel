  "featured_snippet_intro": "Mérida is the elegant capital of the Yucatán—a colonial city known as 'La Ciudad Blanca' (The White City) for its beautiful limestone buildings. This sophisticated cultural hub offers incredible Yucatecan cuisine, vibrant plazas with nightly entertainment, and serves as the perfect base for exploring Chichén Itzá, Uxmal, and the region's magical cenotes.",
  "introduction": "<p>Founded in 1542 on the ruins of the ancient Maya city of T'ho, Mérida became one of the wealthiest cities in the Americas during the henequén (sisal) boom of the late 1800s. The legacy of that era lives on in the grand mansions lining Paseo de Montejo, the tree-lined boulevard modeled after the Champs-Élysées.</p><p>What sets Mérida apart is its living culture. Every night of the week, the main plaza hosts free entertainment: danzón dancing, traditional jarana music, concerts, and markets. The Mayan heritage remains strong, with indigenous language still spoken and traditional dress worn. The food scene showcases Yucatecan cuisine—considered distinct from the rest of Mexico and utterly delicious.</p><p>Beyond the city, the Yucatán Peninsula offers Mexico's richest archaeological heritage—Chichén Itzá is 1.5 hours away, the elaborate Uxmal even closer—along with cenotes, flamingo reserves, and the Gulf Coast beach of Progreso. Mérida offers a window into a proud, unique corner of Mexico.</p>",

    {

      "answer": "Yucatecan cuisine is distinct from the rest of Mexico, influenced by Maya traditions and local ingredients. Must-try dishes include: cochinita pibil (slow-roasted achiote pork), poc chuc (grilled citrus pork), papadzules (egg tacos in pumpkin seed sauce), sopa de lima (lime soup), panuchos and salbutes (stuffed tortillas), and Marquesitas (rolled crepe street snacks)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mérida a good base for visiting Chichén Itzá?",
      "answer": "Yes, Mérida is an excellent base for Chichén Itzá, about 1.5 hours away. You can book tours, rent a car, or take an ADO bus. Staying in Mérida offers more dining, accommodation, and cultural options than staying near the ruins. Leave early (6am) to arrive at opening and beat crowds."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Mérida?",
      "answer": "November to March offers cooler, drier weather. Mérida can be extremely hot and humid from April to October, with temperatures exceeding 35°C (95°F). The shoulder season (October-November) offers good weather and fewer tourists. Holy Week is festive but crowded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mérida safe?",
      "answer": "Mérida is consistently ranked as one of Mexico's safest cities and is often cited as a reason tourists choose it. The centro histórico and tourist areas are very safe to walk day and night. Use normal precautions as you would anywhere. The city's safety is a major factor in its growing popularity with expats and visitors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Mérida?",
      "answer": "Plan for at least 3-4 days: 1-2 days for the city itself (centro, Paseo de Montejo, food scene, nightly entertainment), 1 day for Chichén Itzá or Uxmal, 1 day for cenotes or flamingos. Add more time for the Ruta Puuc, beach at Progreso, or simply enjoying the city's rhythm. Many visitors stay a week or more."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Mérida different from other Mexican cities?",
      "answer": "Mérida's Maya heritage is still very much alive—you'll hear Maya spoken and see traditional dress. The Yucatecan cuisine is distinct and delicious. The city hosts free cultural events every night of the week. It's also one of Mexico's safest cities, with beautiful colonial architecture and easy access to world-class archaeological sites."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there beaches near Mérida?",
      "answer": "Progreso beach is about 30 minutes north of Mérida. It's a popular weekend escape for locals with a long beach, seafood restaurants, and the famous pier. The beach isn't Caribbean-beautiful but offers a nice break from the city. Celestún also has a beach combined with flamingo viewing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to visit cenotes from Mérida?",
      "answer": "Rent a car for maximum flexibility—cenotes are scattered around the region. Popular circuits include Cuzamá (three cenotes accessed by horse cart), Homún (several cenotes close together), and Santa Barbara. Many hotels offer cenote tours. Bring biodegradable sunscreen, water shoes, and cash."
    }
  ],

  "getting_there": "Mérida International Airport (MID) has flights from Mexico City, the US (Houston, Miami, Dallas), and seasonal routes from other cities. The airport is 15 minutes from downtown. ADO luxury buses connect Mérida to Cancún (4 hours), Campeche (2.5 hours), and Playa del Carmen (4 hours).",
  "getting_around": "The centro histórico is very walkable. Use Uber or taxis for longer distances like Paseo de Montejo or Gran Museo del Mundo Maya. For day trips to cenotes and ruins, rent a car for flexibility or join organized tours. Sunday closures of main streets make cycling popular—bikes can be rented throughout the city.",
  "safety_info": "Mérida is consistently ranked as one of Mexico's safest cities. The centro and tourist areas are safe to walk day and night. The city takes safety seriously, and the economy benefits significantly from tourism and expat residents. Use normal precautions: don't flash valuables, use hotel safes, and be aware of your surroundings.",
