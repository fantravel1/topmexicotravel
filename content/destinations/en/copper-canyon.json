The legendary El Chepe train, Tarahumara indigenous culture, and world-class adventure activities make this one of Mexico's most spectacular destinations.",
  "introduction": "<p>Hidden in the remote Sierra Madre Occidental of northern Mexico, Copper Canyon is one of the world's great natural wonders—a vast system of six interconnected canyons that's deeper, larger, and in many ways more dramatic than Arizona's Grand Canyon. The deepest point drops 6,165 feet, and the entire system encompasses over 25,000 square miles of rugged wilderness.</p><p>The legendary El Chepe train (Ferrocarril Chihuahua Pacífico) is one of the world's great railway journeys, traversing 405 miles from Chihuahua to the Pacific coast through 86 tunnels and over 37 bridges. The train clings to cliff faces, descends into subtropical canyons, and passes through remote indigenous communities unchanged by centuries.</p><p>The Tarahumara (Rarámuri) people have called these canyons home for thousands of years. Famous as the world's greatest long-distance runners, they continue traditional ways of life in cave dwellings and remote villages. Their colorful handicrafts, distinctive clothing, and ancient customs add profound cultural depth to the natural spectacle. Copper Canyon offers hiking, zip-lining, mountain biking, and complete wilderness immersion in one of Mexico's most remote destinations.</p>",

    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit?",
      "answer": "October-November offers fall colors and pleasant temperatures. March-April has blooming wildflowers. Avoid summer (June-August) when heavy rains can cause landslides. Winter (December-February) is cold at the rim but pleasant in the lower canyons."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend?",
      "answer": "Minimum 3-4 days: overnight in Creel or Divisadero, with day trips. A week allows time to explore multiple canyon levels, visit Tarahumara villages, and do the full train journey. Two weeks enables hiking and reaching remote areas like Batopilas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Copper Canyon safe?",
      "answer": "The tourist areas (Creel, Divisadero, train route) are safe and well-traveled. This is a remote region, so don't stray far off established routes without a guide. The Tarahumara people are welcoming but respect their privacy. Basic travel precautions apply."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I pack?",
      "answer": "Layers are essential—temperatures vary 30-40°F between rim and canyon floor. Bring warm jacket for rim evenings, lighter clothes for lower elevations. Sturdy hiking shoes, sunscreen, hat, and rain gear (September-November). Bring cash—ATMs are scarce."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Copper Canyon bigger than the Grand Canyon?",
      "answer": "Yes! Copper Canyon is a system of six interconnected canyons that together are larger (25,000+ square miles) and deeper (6,165 feet at deepest point) than Arizona's Grand Canyon. It's often called 'Mexico's Grand Canyon' but many consider it more impressive."

  "getting_around": "El Chepe train connects major points. In Creel, rent a vehicle or hire a taxi for day trips. Most roads are unpaved and require 4x4 for comfort. Tour operators in Creel offer organized trips. Walking is limited to town areas—distances are vast.",
