    "snippet": "Puerto Escondido is Mexico's surf mecca—a laid-back Pacific coast town where legendary Zicatela waves draw pros from around the world, while gentler bays welcome beginners and swimmers. With Oaxacan culture, affordable prices, bioluminescent lagoons, and an authentic beach-town atmosphere, Puerto is the antidote to the Riviera Maya crowds.",
    "full": "The name means 'Hidden Port,' and while Puerto Escondido is no longer a secret, it retains the relaxed, unpretentious vibe that first attracted surfers, backpackers, and bohemians decades ago. The town stretches along a series of bays, each with its own character: Zicatela's thundering barrels for expert surfers and spectators, Carrizalillo's sheltered cove for swimming, La Punta's mellow point break for learners, and Playa Principal's fishing boats and local life.\n\nAs part of Oaxaca state, Puerto Escondido offers incredible food at prices that feel like time travel—fresh seafood, tlayudas, mezcal, and Oaxacan chocolate abound. The nearby Manialtepec Lagoon produces some of Mexico's brightest bioluminescence, and turtle release programs let you witness baby sea turtles make their first journey to the ocean. While gentrification is creeping in, Puerto remains remarkably affordable and authentic, attracting digital nomads, yoga practitioners, and anyone seeking genuine Pacific coast Mexican beach life."
