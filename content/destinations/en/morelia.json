The capital of Michoacán state, it's the gateway to monarch butterfly sanctuaries and home to Mexico's most authentic Day of the Dead celebrations.",
  "introduction": "<p>Morelia is often called Mexico's most beautiful colonial city, and one glance at the rose-pink cantera stone that gives its historic center an ethereal glow explains why. The entire centro histórico is a UNESCO World Heritage site, an extraordinarily well-preserved collection of baroque and neoclassical architecture that includes the magnificent twin-towered cathedral, elegant aqueduct, and countless palaces and plazas.</p><p>But Morelia is more than pretty buildings. As the capital of Michoacán, it's the cultural heart of one of Mexico's most traditional states. The surrounding region is famous for the monarch butterfly migration (November-March), authentic Day of the Dead celebrations in Pátzcuaro and the islands of Lake Pátzcuaro, distinctive Purépecha indigenous culture, and unique cuisine including carnitas and corundas.</p><p>The city itself offers excellent museums, a prestigious music conservatory, and a refined cultural scene. Tree-lined plazas invite lingering over coffee, the aqueduct frames romantic evening walks, and the cathedral's illumination at night is unforgettable. For travelers seeking colonial elegance combined with deep cultural experiences, Morelia is unmatched.</p>",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do I see the monarch butterflies?",
      "answer": "The butterflies are present mid-November through early March, with February being peak. El Rosario is the most visited sanctuary; Sierra Chincua is less crowded. Drive or book a tour from Morelia (2 hours). Arrive by 11am when butterflies are most active. The hike to the colonies is at altitude—take it slow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about Day of the Dead?",
      "answer": "Pátzcuaro and its islands host Mexico's most traditional celebrations (Oct 31-Nov 2). Families spend the night in cemeteries with offerings for deceased loved ones. Janitzio Island is the iconic image, but all cemetery visits are special. Book accommodation 6+ months in advance—it's extremely popular."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Morelia safe?",
      "answer": "Morelia's historic center is safe and well-patrolled. It's a university city with a refined atmosphere. The surrounding Michoacán state has some security concerns in specific areas, but tourist routes (Pátzcuaro, butterfly sanctuaries) are safe. Use normal precautions and you'll have no issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend?",
      "answer": "2-3 days covers the city and one major day trip (butterflies or Pátzcuaro). 4-5 days allows time for multiple day trips and leisurely exploration. During butterfly season or Day of the Dead, plan extra time for the marquee experiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What food should I try?",
      "answer": "Carnitas (slow-cooked pork) are Michoacán's specialty—some of Mexico's best. Try corundas (triangular tamales), uchepos (sweet corn tamales), sopa tarasca (bean and tortilla soup), and enchiladas placeras. Don't miss the sweets at the Mercado de Dulces."

  "getting_around": "The historic center is compact and walkable. Taxis are inexpensive ($2-3 within centro). For day trips (butterflies, Pátzcuaro), rent a car or book tours. Uber operates in Morelia. Local buses serve outlying areas but aren't tourist-friendly.",
