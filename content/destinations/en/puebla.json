Just 2 hours from Mexico City, it makes a perfect day trip or multi-day destination.",
  "introduction": "<p>Founded in 1531, Puebla was designed from scratch as a Spanish colonial city—unlike Mexico City, built atop Aztec Tenochtitlan. This 'city of angels' became one of the most important in New Spain, and its wealth shows in the stunning baroque architecture.</p><p>What distinguishes Puebla is its artisanal heritage, especially Talavera pottery. The distinctive blue-and-white ceramic tiles adorn buildings throughout the historic center. The cuisine is equally renowned: mole poblano (the complex sauce of chilies and chocolate), chiles en nogada (the patriotic dish with walnut sauce), and cemitas (Puebla's signature sandwich).</p><p>The city sits in a valley framed by volcanoes—Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl—and nearby Cholula has the world's largest pyramid by volume. The Amparo Museum is one of Mexico's finest. With excellent restaurants, craft traditions, and easy access from Mexico City, Puebla rewards exploration.</p>",
