    "snippet": "Los Cabos sits at the dramatic southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, where the Pacific Ocean meets the Sea of Cortez. This sun-drenched destination encompasses the party town of Cabo San Lucas and the artsy village of San José del Cabo, connected by a corridor of world-class resorts, championship golf courses, and stunning desert-meets-ocean landscapes.",
    "full": "Los Cabos has transformed from a remote fishing outpost into one of Mexico's most prestigious resort destinations, attracting celebrities, golfers, and sun-seekers with its unique geography and year-round sunshine (350+ sunny days annually). The iconic El Arco—a natural rock arch at Land's End—has become one of Mexico's most photographed landmarks.\n\nThe region offers two distinct experiences: Cabo San Lucas is the lively hub, famous for its marina, sport fishing fleet, beach clubs, and legendary nightlife. Twenty miles northeast, San José del Cabo offers a more refined experience with its historic downtown, art galleries, farm-to-table restaurants, and beautiful estuary. The Tourist Corridor connecting them is home to mega-resorts, world-ranked golf courses, and pristine swimming beaches. Whether you're here for the party scene, a romantic getaway, world-class fishing, or simply to bask in the desert sun, Los Cabos delivers a Mexican vacation unlike any other."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo?",
      "answer": "Cabo San Lucas is the party town with marina nightlife, beach clubs, and touristy atmosphere. San José del Cabo is quieter and more refined, with a historic downtown, art galleries, and upscale restaurants. The Tourist Corridor between them has most of the luxury resorts and golf courses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you swim at the beaches in Los Cabos?",

    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Los Cabos?",
      "answer": "November to June offers ideal weather with minimal rain. December-April is peak season (and whale watching season). Summer (July-October) brings humidity, potential hurricanes, and occasional rain, but also lower prices and excellent fishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Cabos safe?",
      "answer": "Los Cabos tourist areas are generally very safe. The economy depends heavily on tourism, and security is a priority. Use normal precautions, avoid isolated areas at night, and book tours through reputable operators. Cabo San Lucas's downtown can get rowdy late at night."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Cabos expensive?",
      "answer": "Yes, Los Cabos is one of Mexico's most expensive destinations due to its luxury positioning and remote location. Budget travelers can find mid-range options in downtown Cabo San Lucas or San José del Cabo, but beach resorts and dining tend to be pricey."
