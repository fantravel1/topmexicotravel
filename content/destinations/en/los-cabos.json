The iconic El Arco—a natural rock arch at Land's End—has become one of Mexico's most photographed landmarks.</p><p>The region offers two distinct experiences: Cabo San Lucas is the lively hub, famous for its marina, sport fishing fleet, beach clubs, and legendary nightlife. Twenty miles northeast, San José del Cabo offers a more refined experience with its historic downtown, art galleries, farm-to-table restaurants, and beautiful estuary. The Tourist Corridor connecting them hosts mega-resorts, world-ranked golf courses, and pristine swimming beaches.</p><p>Whether you're here for the party scene, a romantic getaway, world-class fishing, championship golf, or simply to bask in the desert sun, Los Cabos delivers a Mexican vacation unlike any other.</p>",
