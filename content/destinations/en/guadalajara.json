    "snippet": "Guadalajara is Mexico's second-largest city and its cultural heart—the birthplace of mariachi music, tequila, and the charro (Mexican cowboy). This dynamic metropolis offers stunning colonial architecture, innovative culinary scene, vibrant neighborhoods, and serves as the gateway to the magical agave fields of Tequila country.",
    "full": "Often overlooked by international tourists in favor of beach resorts, Guadalajara rewards visitors with a deeper dive into Mexican culture and contemporary urban life. The tapatíos (as locals are called) are known for their warmth and pride in their city's contributions to Mexican identity—from the haunting melodies of mariachi born in the plazas of Tlaquepaque to the blue agave fields that produce the world's tequila.\n\nThe historic center showcases colonial grandeur, from the twin-spired cathedral to the ornate Teatro Degollado and the Hospicio Cabañas with its famous Orozco murals. But Guadalajara is also thoroughly modern, with thriving neighborhoods like Chapultepec and Americana offering trendy restaurants, craft cocktail bars, and boutique shopping. The city's food scene has exploded in recent years, earning recognition as a gastronomic destination. And with the town of Tequila just an hour away—complete with the scenic Tequila Express train and José Cuervo express—no visit is complete without exploring where Mexico's national spirit is born."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Guadalajara safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Tourist areas like Centro Histórico, Chapultepec, Americana, and Tlaquepaque are generally safe. Use normal urban precautions, especially at night.

    {
      "question": "How many days do you need in Guadalajara?",
      "answer": "Plan for 3-4 days: 1-2 days for the historic center and neighborhoods, 1 day for Tlaquepaque and/or a tequila tour, and optionally 1 day for Lake Chapala. Food and culture enthusiasts could easily spend a week exploring the region."
    },
    {
      "question": "What food is Guadalajara known for?",
      "answer": "Must-try dishes include: tortas ahogadas (drowned sandwiches), birria (stewed meat), carne en su jugo (beef in its juices), tejuino (fermented corn drink), and of course tequila. The city has also developed a sophisticated contemporary food scene."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best neighborhood to stay in Guadalajara?",
      "answer": "Chapultepec and Americana are the best areas for visitors—walkable, trendy neighborhoods with excellent restaurants, bars, and shopping. Centro Histórico puts you in the colonial heart but is busier. Tlaquepaque is charming but quieter at night."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Guadalajara?",
      "answer": "October to May offers pleasant weather. The rainy season (June-September) brings afternoon showers. September features Independence Day and the famous Mariachi Festival. October brings the International Film Festival. Avoid Holy Week if you want to visit Tequila (very crowded)."
