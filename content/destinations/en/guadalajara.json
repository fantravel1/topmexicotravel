    "snippet": "Guadalajara is Mexico's second-largest city and its cultural heart—the birthplace of mariachi music, tequila, and the charro (Mexican cowboy). This dynamic metropolis offers stunning colonial architecture, innovative culinary scene, vibrant neighborhoods, and serves as the gateway to the magical agave fields of Tequila country.",
    "full": "Often overlooked by international tourists in favor of beach resorts, Guadalajara rewards visitors with a deeper dive into Mexican culture and contemporary urban life. The tapatíos (as locals are called) are known for their warmth and pride in their city's contributions to Mexican identity—from the haunting melodies of mariachi born in the plazas of Tlaquepaque to the blue agave fields that produce the world's tequila.\n\nThe historic center showcases colonial grandeur, from the twin-spired cathedral to the ornate Teatro Degollado and the Hospicio Cabañas with its famous Orozco murals. But Guadalajara is also thoroughly modern, with thriving neighborhoods like Chapultepec and Americana offering trendy restaurants, craft cocktail bars, and boutique shopping. The city's food scene has exploded in recent years, earning recognition as a gastronomic destination. And with the town of Tequila just an hour away—complete with the scenic Tequila Express train and José Cuervo express—no visit is complete without exploring where Mexico's national spirit is born."

  "getting_there": "Guadalajara International Airport (GDL) has direct flights from major US cities (LA, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Phoenix) and throughout Mexico. The airport is 20 minutes from downtown. ADO and ETN buses connect to Mexico City (6 hours), Puerto Vallarta (4.5 hours), and other major cities.",
  "getting_around": "Uber is the easiest way to navigate the sprawling metro area. The city has an efficient light rail (Tren Ligero) and bus system, though it can be confusing. Walking works well within neighborhoods (Centro, Chapultepec, Tlaquepaque) but not between them. Taxis are available but Uber is generally preferred.",
  "safety_info": "Tourist areas like Centro Histórico, Chapultepec, Americana, and Tlaquepaque are generally safe. Use normal urban precautions: avoid flashy jewelry, use Uber at night, stay aware in crowded markets. The city is safer than its sometimes-undeserved reputation suggests, but certain outlying areas should be avoided.",

      "question": "Is Guadalajara safe for tourists?",
      "answer": "Tourist areas like Centro Histórico, Chapultepec, Americana, and Tlaquepaque are generally safe. Use normal urban precautions, especially at night. Use Uber rather than street taxis.

      "answer": "Plan for 3-4 days: 1-2 days for the historic center and neighborhoods, 1 day for Tlaquepaque, and 1 day for a tequila tour. Food and culture enthusiasts could easily spend a week exploring the city and region, including day trips to Lake Chapala or mountain Pueblos Mágicos."

    {
      "question": "What food is Guadalajara known for?",
      "answer": "Must-try dishes include: tortas ahogadas (drowned pork sandwiches), birria (slow-cooked spiced meat stew), carne en su jugo (beef in its juices with bacon and beans), tejuino (fermented corn drink), and of course tequila.

    {
      "question": "What is the best neighborhood to stay in Guadalajara?",
      "answer": "Chapultepec and Americana are the best areas for visitors—walkable, trendy neighborhoods with excellent restaurants, bars, and boutique hotels.

      "question": "Is Guadalajara worth visiting?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Guadalajara offers deep cultural immersion that beach resorts can't match: the birthplace of tequila and mariachi, stunning colonial architecture, world-class museums, excellent food, and authentic Mexican urban life. It's ideal for travelers seeking culture over beaches."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Guadalajara different from Mexico City?",
      "answer": "Guadalajara is smaller, less chaotic, and more traditionally 'Mexican'—it's the heartland that gave birth to mariachi and tequila. The food scene is excellent but more regional. The colonial architecture is better preserved. It lacks CDMX's museums and cultural breadth but offers a more manageable, distinctly Jalisco experience."
