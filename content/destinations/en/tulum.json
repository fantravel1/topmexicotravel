    "snippet": "Tulum has evolved from a backpacker secret into Mexico's most Instagram-famous destination, known for its clifftop Mayan ruins, pristine Caribbean beaches, mystical cenotes, and bohemian-luxe hotels. This laid-back paradise on the Riviera Maya perfectly blends ancient history, natural beauty, and contemporary cool.",
    "full": "Perched on the cliffs of the Caribbean coast, Tulum was once an important Mayan trading port and is now the only major archaeological site in Mexico overlooking the sea. But modern Tulum extends far beyond its ancient ruins. The beach road (Zona Hotelera) has transformed into a destination unto itself, lined with design-forward boutique hotels, beach clubs, and farm-to-table restaurants that attract a global creative crowd.\n\nBeyond the Instagram aesthetics, Tulum offers genuine natural wonders. The region is dotted with cenotes—sacred underground swimming holes formed by collapsed limestone—each with its own character. The Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve to the south protects one of Mexico's most pristine ecosystems. While Tulum has become more developed and expensive, it still rewards visitors with moments of Caribbean magic, especially at sunrise when the ruins are nearly empty or floating in a cenote's crystal-clear waters."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Tulum expensive?",
      "answer": "Yes, Tulum is one of Mexico's most expensive destinations. Beach hotel rates range from $200-1000+ per night. However, staying in Tulum Town (10 minutes from beach) offers better value at $50-150 per night. Street food and local restaurants are still affordable, while beach restaurants charge premium prices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get from Cancún airport to Tulum?",
      "answer": "Tulum is about 2 hours south of Cancún airport. Options include: ADO bus ($15-20 USD, comfortable and frequent), private transfer ($100-150 USD for car), rental car (convenient for cenote hopping), or shared shuttles ($25-40 USD per person)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Tulum?",
      "answer": "November to April offers the best weather with dry days and comfortable temperatures. December-March is peak season with highest prices. May-June is hot but less crowded. Avoid September-October for hurricane season. Sargassum seaweed can affect beaches, particularly May-August."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the beaches in Tulum public?",
      "answer": "Yes, all beaches in Mexico are public by law. However, many Tulum beach hotels make access difficult. Look for public access points between hotels, or use the beach at the Tulum ruins. Some beaches have significant sargassum seaweed seasonally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a car in Tulum?",
      "answer": "A rental car is helpful for visiting cenotes and exploring independently. Alternatively, rent a bicycle for the beach zone, use taxis between town and beach ($5-10 USD), or book guided tours. The beach road can be congested, and parking is limited."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cenotes should I visit in Tulum?",
      "answer": "Gran Cenote is the most accessible and beautiful for first-timers. Cenote Dos Ojos is spectacular for snorkeling or diving. Cenote Calavera offers cliff jumping. Cenote Azul is family-friendly. Visit early morning (before 10am) to avoid crowds and tour groups."
