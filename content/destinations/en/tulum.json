    "snippet": "Tulum is where ancient Mayan history meets bohemian beach culture. Famous for its stunning clifftop ruins overlooking the Caribbean Sea, powder-white beaches, mystical cenotes, and eco-chic hotels, Tulum has become Mexico's most sought-after destination for travelers seeking a blend of culture, nature, and style.",
    "full": "Once a walled Mayan city that served as a major trading port, Tulum is now one of Mexico's most captivating destinations. The archaeological site, perched dramatically on 12-meter cliffs above the turquoise Caribbean, is the only Mayan ruin overlooking the sea—making it perhaps the most photographed archaeological site in the Americas.\n\nBeyond the ruins, Tulum has evolved into a unique destination that defies categorization. The beach road (Zona Hotelera) stretches for several kilometers, lined with boutique eco-hotels, yoga retreats, and farm-to-table restaurants—many without electricity, running on solar power and lit by candlelight. It's a place where wellness, sustainability, and barefoot luxury converge.\n\nThe surrounding area offers some of the Yucatán's most spectacular cenotes—sacred sinkholes connected by underground rivers that were central to Mayan cosmology. Today, these crystal-clear pools offer magical swimming and diving experiences. Whether you're exploring ancient history, lounging on pristine beaches, or seeking spiritual renewal, Tulum delivers an experience unlike anywhere else in the Caribbean."

    {
      "question": "What is the best time to visit Tulum?",
      "answer": "November to April offers the best weather with less rain and comfortable temperatures. The peak season (December-March) has the best weather but highest prices. Avoid September-October for hurricane season. Summer can be hot with afternoon showers and sargassum seaweed on beaches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stay on the beach or in town (pueblo)?",
      "answer": "Beach zone offers the iconic Tulum experience with eco-hotels and stunning beaches, but at premium prices with limited WiFi. Pueblo is authentic, budget-friendly, and 10 minutes by bike from the beach. Many visitors split their stay between both areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get around Tulum?",
      "answer": "Bikes are the most popular way to get around - most hotels rent them. The beach zone has one main road, and pueblo is compact. Taxis work for longer distances. Rent a car for day trips to cenotes, Cobá, or Sian Ka'an."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Tulum expensive?",
      "answer": "Tulum's beach zone is expensive by Mexico standards - comparable to trendy US destinations. Budget travelers should stay in pueblo where you can find good hotels for $50-80/night and tacos for $2. Beach zone hotels start around $200-300/night and meals $40-80."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the sargassum (seaweed) situation?",
      "answer": "Sargassum seaweed can affect beaches from May to September, varying by year. Hotels clean their beach sections, but open beaches may be affected. Check recent photos before booking summer trips. The seaweed doesn't affect cenotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I visit Tulum as a day trip from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Yes, Tulum is about 1.5-2 hours from Cancún. Many tours combine the ruins with cenotes or beach time. However, to truly experience Tulum's bohemian beach vibe, at least 2-3 nights is recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Tulum safe?",
      "answer": "Tulum is generally safe for tourists. Use normal precautions: don't leave valuables on the beach, take authorized transportation at night, and be aware of your surroundings. The main tourist areas are well-patrolled."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to book cenotes in advance?",
      "answer": "For popular cenotes like Gran Cenote and Dos Ojos, no reservation is needed - just show up. Arrive early morning (8-9am) for fewer crowds. Some private cenotes and cave diving experiences require advance booking."
    }

  "practical_info": {
    "getting_there": "Fly into Cancún International Airport (CUN), then it's about 1.5-2 hours to Tulum by car, shuttle, or ADO bus ($15-20 USD). Private transfers cost $100-150 USD. Tulum has a small airport for private planes only.",
    "getting_around": "Bikes are king in Tulum - rent one for $10-15/day. The beach road is bikeable end-to-end. Taxis charge fixed rates ($5-10 within town, $15-20 to beach zone). Rent a car for day trips to cenotes and archaeological sites.",
