    "snippet": "Todos Santos is Baja California Sur's bohemian heart—a Pueblo Mágico oasis where desert meets Pacific, colonial architecture houses world-class galleries, and artists and surfers have created one of Mexico's most culturally rich small towns. Just an hour from Cabo, this palm-lined retreat offers a completely different experience from its party-focused neighbor.",
    "full": "Nestled between the Sierra de la Laguna mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Todos Santos was founded in 1723 as a Jesuit mission. The town flourished during the sugarcane boom of the 1800s, declined when the industry collapsed, and was reborn in the 1980s when artists discovered its perfect light, affordable real estate, and inspiring landscapes. Today, the historic center is filled with galleries, boutique hotels, and restaurants that rival any in Los Cabos—at a fraction of the price and pretension.\n\nThe town is perhaps most famous for the Hotel California, which may or may not have inspired the Eagles' legendary song (the band denies it, but the hotel embraces the mystery). Beyond the myth, Todos Santos offers genuine appeal: organic farms supply excellent restaurants, surf breaks like Cerritos and San Pedrito attract wave riders of all levels, sea turtles nest on local beaches, and the annual Open Studios event showcases the thriving art community.\n\nTodos Santos is where Baja's raw desert beauty meets sophisticated culture. You'll find serious art collectors alongside surfers, organic farmers alongside celebrity chefs, and Mexican heritage alongside expat creativity. Whether you're fleeing Cabo's party scene or seeking an authentic Baja experience, Todos Santos delivers creative soul in a stunning desert-meets-ocean setting."

      "question": "Is Hotel California related to the Eagles song?",
      "answer": "The Eagles have officially denied any connection, saying the song is metaphorical. However, the hotel has embraced the legend with memorabilia, a guitar-shaped pool, and mystique. The hotel opened in 1950 (rebuilt after a fire in the 1960s); the song was released in 1977. The truth is unknowable—but visiting is fun regardless."

      "question": "How do I get to Todos Santos?",
      "answer": "Fly into San José del Cabo Airport (SJD) and drive about 1 hour north on Highway 19 through beautiful desert landscape. Rent a car (recommended for beaches and day trips) or take a taxi/shuttle ($100-150 USD). No public buses serve Todos Santos directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Todos Santos better than Cabo?",
      "answer": "They're very different experiences. Todos Santos is quieter, artier, more affordable, with a bohemian vibe and no major nightlife. Cabo is resort-focused with mega-hotels, golf, sport fishing, and party scene. Many visitors stay in Todos Santos and day-trip to Cabo for the contrast."

    {
      "question": "Can you surf in Todos Santos?",
      "answer": "Yes—the area has excellent surf. Playa Cerritos (15 minutes south) is one of Baja's best beginner-intermediate beaches with surf schools and consistent waves. San Pedrito offers more challenging conditions for experienced surfers. Note: town beaches have strong currents—swim at designated areas only."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Todos Santos expensive?",
      "answer": "Todos Santos is mid-to-high range for Mexico—cheaper than Cabo, comparable to San Miguel de Allende. Boutique hotels run $150-400+ per night. Farm-to-table restaurants are pricey by Mexican standards ($25-50/person for dinner) but excellent value for the quality. Budget options are limited."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Todos Santos?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal for exploring galleries, beaches, and restaurants. Add an extra day each for day trips to Cabo, La Paz, or whale watching at Magdalena Bay. Art enthusiasts may want 4-5 days, especially during Open Studios in February."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Todos Santos safe?",
      "answer": "Todos Santos is very safe. The small artistic community and significant expat population mean security is taken seriously. Violent crime against tourists is essentially unheard of.
