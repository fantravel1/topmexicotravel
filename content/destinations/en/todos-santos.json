    "snippet": "Todos Santos is Baja California Sur's bohemian heart—a Pueblo Mágico oasis where desert meets Pacific, colonial architecture houses world-class galleries, and artists and surfers have created one of Mexico's most culturally rich small towns. Just an hour from Cabo, this palm-lined retreat offers a completely different experience.",
    "full": "Nestled between the Sierra de la Laguna mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Todos Santos was founded in 1723 as a Jesuit mission. The town flourished during the sugarcane boom of the 1800s, declined when the industry collapsed, and was reborn in the 1980s when artists discovered its perfect light, cheap real estate, and inspiring landscapes. Today, the historic center is filled with galleries, boutique hotels, and restaurants that rival any in Los Cabos—at a fraction of the price and pretension.\n\nThe town is perhaps most famous for the Hotel California, which may or may not have inspired the Eagles' song (the band denies it, the hotel embraces the legend). Beyond the myth, Todos Santos offers genuine appeal: organic farms supply excellent restaurants, surf breaks like Cerritos and San Pedrito attract wave riders of all levels, sea turtles nest on local beaches, and the annual Open Studios event showcases the thriving art community. Whether you're fleeing Cabo's party scene or seeking an authentic Baja experience, Todos Santos delivers creative soul in a stunning desert setting."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Hotel California related to the Eagles song?",
      "answer": "The Eagles have denied any connection, saying the song is metaphorical. However, the hotel has embraced the legend with memorabilia and guitar-shaped pool. The truth is unknowable—but visiting is fun regardless. The hotel opened in 1950; the song was released in 1977."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Todos Santos?",
      "answer": "Fly into San José del Cabo (SJD) and drive about 1 hour north on Highway 19. The drive through desert landscape is beautiful. Alternatively, take a taxi or shuttle from Cabo (~$100-150 USD). No public buses serve Todos Santos directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Todos Santos better than Cabo?",
      "answer": "They're very different experiences. Todos Santos is quieter, artier, more affordable, with a bohemian vibe and no major nightlife. Cabo is resort-focused, with mega-hotels, golf, and party scene. Many visitors stay in Todos Santos and day-trip to Cabo, or vice versa."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you surf in Todos Santos?",
      "answer": "Yes! Playa Cerritos (15 minutes south) is one of Baja's best beginner beaches with surf schools and consistent waves. More advanced surfers head to San Pedrito or Los Cerritos Point. Note: town beaches can have strong currents—swim at designated areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the Todos Santos art season?",
      "answer": "While galleries are open year-round, the art scene peaks during the annual Open Studios tour in February, when artists throughout town open their doors. The Festival de Cine and Founder's Day (October) also bring cultural events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Todos Santos expensive?",
      "answer": "Todos Santos is mid-to-high range for Mexico—cheaper than Cabo, comparable to San Miguel de Allende. Boutique hotels run $150-400+ per night. Farm-to-table restaurants are pricey by Mexican standards but excellent value for the quality. Budget options are limited."
