  "featured_snippet_intro": "San Cristóbal de las Casas is a magical colonial city in the Chiapas highlands where living Maya cultures, cobblestone streets, indigenous markets, and cloud forests create one of Mexico's most atmospheric destinations. It's the gateway to Palenque, Sumidero Canyon, and stunning jungle waterfalls.",
  "introduction": "<p>Nestled at 7,000 feet in the misty highlands of Chiapas, San Cristóbal de las Casas feels like stepping into another era. This colonial city, founded by the Spanish in 1528, remains deeply connected to the indigenous Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya peoples whose villages dot the surrounding mountains. Here, women in traditional embroidered huipiles sell handicrafts in markets, shamanic ceremonies blend Catholic and pre-Hispanic traditions, and the aroma of locally grown coffee fills cobblestone streets.</p><p>San Cristóbal serves as the cultural heart of Chiapas and the perfect base for exploring this remote, biodiverse state. Day trips reveal ancient Mayan ruins at Palenque rising from the jungle, the dramatic Sumidero Canyon with its 1,000-meter walls, turquoise waterfalls at Agua Azul, and traditional villages where outsiders are genuinely welcomed into ancient customs.</p><p>The city itself is a treasure: baroque churches, colorful markets overflowing with amber jewelry and textiles, excellent restaurants serving Chiapan cuisine, and a bohemian traveler scene that has called this place home for decades. Cool mountain weather, warm indigenous culture, and adventure around every corner make San Cristóbal one of Mexico's most rewarding destinations.</p>",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is San Cristóbal safe for travelers?",
      "answer": "San Cristóbal is one of Mexico's safest tourist destinations. The colonial center is very walkable day and night. Surrounding villages welcome respectful tourists. Exercise normal caution, don't display expensive items, and you'll have no problems. The bigger concern is altitude adjustment (7,000 feet) for the first day or two."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the weather like?",
      "answer": "Due to altitude (7,000 feet), San Cristóbal has spring-like weather year-round. Days are mild (65-75°F) but mornings and evenings are cold (40-50°F). Bring layers, a warm jacket, and rain gear (especially May-October). It's much cooler than coastal Mexico—pack accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to San Cristóbal?",
      "answer": "Fly to Tuxtla Gutiérrez (TGZ, 1 hour drive) or smaller San Cristóbal airport (SZT) with connections through Mexico City. ADO buses from Oaxaca (10 hours), Mexico City (12 hours), and Palenque (5 hours) are comfortable. From Cancún/Riviera Maya, fly via Mexico City."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time should I spend?",
      "answer": "Minimum 3-4 days: one day for the city, one for Chamula/Zinacantán villages, and one for a major day trip (Sumidero or start of Palenque trip). A week allows Palenque with overnight, Lagos de Montebello, and relaxed exploration. Two weeks lets you fully explore Chiapas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I visit indigenous villages respectfully?",
      "answer": "Yes, but respect is essential. Never photograph people without permission (and expect to pay a small tip). No photography inside Chamula church. Dress modestly. Hire local guides who understand protocols. These are living communities, not tourist attractions—approach with humility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I buy in San Cristóbal?",
      "answer": "Chiapan amber (buy from reputable shops to avoid fakes), textiles and huipiles from indigenous weavers, locally roasted coffee, handmade ceramics, and posh (traditional wool garments). The market around Santo Domingo is excellent for crafts. Buy directly from artisans when possible."
    }
  ],

  "getting_there": "Fly to Tuxtla Gutiérrez Airport (TGZ) with connections from Mexico City (1.5 hours). Airport is 1 hour from San Cristóbal; shuttles run regularly. Alternatively, ADO buses connect to Oaxaca (10 hours), Mexico City (12-14 hours), and Palenque (5 hours). From Cancún area, fly via Mexico City.",
  "getting_around": "The colonial center is entirely walkable. Colectivo vans to nearby villages (Chamula, Zinacantán) leave from the market area for $1-2. For day trips (Palenque, Sumidero, Lagos), book tours or hire private transport. No Uber; use radio taxis for trips around town.",
  "safety_info": "San Cristóbal is very safe for tourists. The historic center is well-patrolled and busy until late. Exercise normal precautions: don't display expensive items, use hotel safes, avoid isolated areas at night. Political protests occasionally occur but are typically peaceful. Altitude (7,000 feet) may affect some visitors—take it easy on arrival.",
