  "introduction": "<p>Founded in 1540, Campeche was one of the most important ports in colonial Mexico, making it a prime target for pirates including Sir Francis Drake. The massive stone walls, bastions, and forts built to protect it still stand today, giving the city its unique character.</p><p>The historic center is a photographer's dream: streets of perfectly restored colonial buildings painted in vibrant pastels—coral, mustard, turquoise, pink—with ornate ironwork balconies and massive wooden doors. By night, the walls are illuminated and the malecón comes alive.</p><p>Beyond the city, Campeche state holds some of Mexico's most impressive Maya sites. Calakmul, deep in the jungle biosphere reserve, rivals Tikal in scale. Edzná features the unique five-story Palace. The region remains wonderfully uncrowded.</p>",
