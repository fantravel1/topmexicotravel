    "snippet": "Valladolid is the Yucatán Peninsula's most charming colonial city—a Pueblo Mágico where pastel-colored buildings line cobblestone streets, cenotes hide within city limits, and authentic Yucatecan culture thrives untouched by mass tourism. Perfectly positioned between Mérida and Cancún, it's the ideal base for exploring Chichén Itzá and the region's finest cenotes.",
    "full": "Founded by the Spanish in 1543, Valladolid was built on the sacred Maya city of Zací and became an important colonial center in the Yucatán. The city played a role in the Caste War of Yucatán and has preserved its historic character while the coastal regions transformed with tourism. Today, Valladolid offers a more authentic, slower-paced alternative to the beaches, with genuine Yucatecan food, Maya heritage, and prices that feel refreshingly fair.\n\nWhat makes Valladolid special is its perfect location and preserved charm. Cenote Zací sits right in town—a massive underground swimming hole within walking distance of the main plaza. The famous cenotes of the region (Suytun, Ik Kil, Oxman) are minutes away, and Chichén Itzá is just 40 minutes by car. The town itself rewards exploration with its Calzada de los Frailes (a photogenic street leading to the San Bernardino convent), excellent restaurants serving Yucatecan cuisine, and a main plaza alive with local life.\n\nWhether you're using Valladolid as a base for cenote-hopping and archaeological exploration, or discovering it as a destination in its own right, this colonial gem delivers the real Mexico—colonial architecture, Maya heritage, traditional cuisine, and genuine warmth—at a fraction of the price and crowds of coastal destinations."

    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid worth visiting?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Valladolid offers authentic colonial Mexico, excellent cenotes, proximity to Chichén Itzá and Ek Balam, and genuine Yucatecan culture at fair prices. It's a refreshing alternative to beach resorts and increasingly popular with travelers seeking deeper experiences. Most visitors wish they'd stayed longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Valladolid from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Valladolid is about 2 hours from Cancún airport by car or ADO bus (frequent service, $15-20 USD). It's 40 minutes from Chichén Itzá, 2 hours from Mérida, and 1.5 hours from Tulum. The central location makes it an ideal base for exploring the entire Yucatán Peninsula."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Valladolid?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal: one day exploring the town and Cenote Zací, one day at Chichén Itzá, and one day for cenote hopping (Suytun, Oxman) or Ek Balam. If you're an archaeology enthusiast or cenote lover, 4 days allows for Cobá and Río Lagartos. Even an overnight stay is worthwhile if you're passing through."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid cheaper than the beach destinations?",
      "answer": "Yes, significantly. Hotels, restaurants, and activities in Valladolid cost 30-50% less than Tulum, Playa del Carmen, or Cancún. A nice boutique hotel room runs $60-150/night, excellent meals $5-15, and cenote admission $3-15 USD. It's one of Yucatán's best-value destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cenotes near Valladolid should I visit?",
      "answer": "Cenote Zací is in town—don't miss it. For day trips: Suytun has the famous light beam and platform (photogenic but crowded), Oxman has a rope swing and hacienda setting, X'canché near Ek Balam is beautiful and less touristy, and Ik Kil near Chichén Itzá is dramatic but very crowded. Visit early morning for fewer people."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid safe?",
      "answer": "Valladolid is very safe for tourists. The small colonial city has a peaceful atmosphere and strong community. Violent crime against tourists is essentially unheard of. Normal precautions apply: watch valuables in crowded areas. The town is well-lit and feels safe walking at night."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stay in Valladolid or the beach?",
      "answer": "Both have merits. Valladolid offers authenticity, lower prices, cenotes, ruins, and culture without beach-resort atmosphere. If beaches are essential, stay on the coast. Many travelers split time between both—Valladolid makes an excellent 2-3 night interior stop between Cancún and Mérida."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best way to visit Chichén Itzá from Valladolid?",
      "answer": "Drive or taxi (40 minutes) and arrive at 8am when it opens to beat cruise ship crowds. Alternatively, stay for the evening light and sound show. Colectivos run from the bus station ($2 USD). Tours are available but less flexible. Visit early, return for lunch in Valladolid."
