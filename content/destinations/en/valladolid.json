  "introduction": {
    "snippet": "Valladolid is the Yucatán Peninsula's most charming colonial city—a Pueblo Mágico where pastel-colored buildings line cobblestone streets, cenotes hide within city limits, and authentic Yucatecan culture thrives untouched by mass tourism. Perfectly positioned between Mérida and Cancún, it's the ideal base for exploring Chichén Itzá and the region's finest cenotes.",
    "full": "Founded by the Spanish in 1543, Valladolid was built on the sacred Maya city of Zací and became an important colonial center in the Yucatán. The city played a role in the Caste War of Yucatán and has preserved its historic character while the coastal regions transformed with tourism. Today, Valladolid offers a more authentic, slower-paced alternative to the beaches, with genuine Yucatecan food, Maya heritage, and prices that feel refreshingly fair.\n\nWhat makes Valladolid special is its perfect location and preserved charm. Cenote Zací sits right in town—a massive underground swimming hole within walking distance of the main plaza. The famous cenotes of the region (Suytun, Ik Kil, Oxman) are minutes away, and Chichén Itzá is just 40 minutes by car. The town itself rewards exploration with its Calzada de los Frailes (a photogenic street leading to the San Bernardino convent), excellent restaurants serving Yucatecan cuisine, and a main plaza alive with local life. Whether you're using Valladolid as a base or discovering it as a destination, this colonial gem delivers the real Mexico."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid worth visiting?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Valladolid offers authentic colonial Mexico, excellent cenotes, proximity to Chichén Itzá, and genuine Yucatecan culture at fair prices. It's a refreshing alternative to beach resorts and increasingly popular with travelers seeking deeper experiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Valladolid from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Valladolid is about 2 hours from Cancún airport by car or ADO bus (frequent service, ~$15 USD). It's 40 minutes from Chichén Itzá, 2 hours from Mérida, and 1.5 hours from Tulum. The central location makes it an ideal base."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend in Valladolid?",
      "answer": "2-3 days is ideal: one day exploring the town and Cenote Zací, one day at Chichén Itzá, and one day for cenote hopping (Suytun, Oxman, Ik Kil). If continuing to other destinations, even an overnight stay is worthwhile."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid cheaper than the beach destinations?",
      "answer": "Yes. Hotels, restaurants, and activities in Valladolid cost significantly less than Tulum, Playa del Carmen, or Cancún. A nice boutique hotel room runs $60-150/night, excellent meals $5-15. It's one of Yucatán's best-value destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cenotes near Valladolid should I visit?",
      "answer": "Cenote Zací is in town—don't miss it. For day trips: Suytun is Instagram-famous but crowded, Oxman has a rope swing and hacienda setting, X'keken (Dzitnup) has dramatic stalactites, and Ik Kil near Chichén Itzá is beautiful but touristy. Visit early morning to avoid crowds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Valladolid safe?",
      "answer": "Valladolid is very safe. The small colonial city has a peaceful atmosphere and strong community. Normal precautions apply, but violent crime against tourists is essentially unheard of. It's one of the safest destinations in the Yucatán."
