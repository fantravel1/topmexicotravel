    "snippet": "Puerto Vallarta offers the rare combination of a genuine Mexican town with world-class resort amenities. Nestled between the Sierra Madre mountains and the sparkling Banderas Bay, this Pacific gem features cobblestone streets, a famous malecón boardwalk, thriving arts scene, and a welcoming atmosphere that has made it Mexico's most beloved beach town.",
    "full": "Puerto Vallarta rose to fame after the 1964 film 'The Night of the Iguana' brought Hollywood to its shores, beginning a love affair with international travelers that continues today. Unlike purpose-built resort destinations, Vallarta grew organically from a traditional Mexican fishing village, and its charming centro histórico (old town) with the iconic crown-topped Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe remains the heart of the city.\n\nThe city stretches along one of Mexico's largest bays, offering something for everyone: the Romantic Zone draws LGBTQ+ travelers and foodies with its vibrant nightlife and restaurants, Marina Vallarta hosts golfers and boaters, while the Hotel Zone caters to resort seekers. Beyond the beaches, the surrounding jungle offers zip-lining, waterfall hikes, and whale watching (November-March). Puerto Vallarta has also become one of Mexico's top culinary destinations, with a food scene that ranges from authentic taco stands to James Beard-nominated restaurants."

      "answer": "Yes, Puerto Vallarta is one of Latin America's most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations. The Romantic Zone has numerous gay bars, clubs, hotels, and a vibrant community. The annual Pride celebration in May is one of Mexico's largest. The city welcomes LGBTQ+ travelers year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to visit Puerto Vallarta?",

    {
      "question": "Is the water safe to swim in Puerto Vallarta?",
      "answer": "Most Puerto Vallarta beaches are safe for swimming, though Pacific waters can have stronger waves and currents than the Caribbean. Popular safe beaches include Playa Los Muertos in the Romantic Zone and hotel zone beaches. Check local conditions and watch for flags."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get from the airport to downtown Puerto Vallarta?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Puerto Vallarta safe for tourists?",
