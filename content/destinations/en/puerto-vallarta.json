  "introduction": "<p>Puerto Vallarta rose to fame after the 1964 film 'The Night of the Iguana' brought Hollywood to its shores, beginning a love affair with international travelers that continues today. Unlike purpose-built resort destinations, Vallarta grew organically from a traditional Mexican fishing village, and its charming centro histórico (old town) with the iconic crown-topped Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe remains the heart of the city.</p><p>The city stretches along one of Mexico's largest bays, offering something for everyone: the Romantic Zone draws LGBTQ+ travelers and foodies with its vibrant nightlife and restaurants, Marina Vallarta hosts golfers and boaters, while the Hotel Zone caters to resort seekers. Beyond the beaches, the surrounding jungle offers zip-lining, waterfall hikes, and whale watching (November-March).</p><p>Puerto Vallarta has also become one of Mexico's top culinary destinations, with a food scene ranging from authentic taco stands to James Beard-nominated restaurants. Add world-class sunsets, warm Pacific waters, and a welcoming local community, and you have Mexico's most complete beach destination.</p>",

Vallarta has better dining, arts scenes, and LGBTQ+ nightlife. Cancún has calmer Caribbean beaches and larger resorts. Vallarta attracts couples and LGBTQ+ travelers; Cancún draws more families and spring breakers. Both are excellent—it depends on your priorities."
