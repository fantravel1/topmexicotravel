    "snippet": "Holbox (pronounced hol-BOSH) is a car-free island paradise where sandy streets replace pavement, golf carts outnumber cars, and nature takes center stage. This bohemian Caribbean hideaway offers pristine beaches, legendary bioluminescent waters, whale shark encounters, and an authentically laid-back atmosphere that's increasingly rare in Mexico.",
    "full": "Floating in the shallow waters where the Gulf of Mexico meets the Caribbean Sea, Holbox island has long been a secret shared among backpackers and nature lovers. Part of the Yum Balam Biosphere Reserve, the island hosts flamingos, pelicans, and (from May to September) hundreds of whale sharks that gather in the nutrient-rich waters nearby.\n\nHolbox's unpaved streets, colorful murals, and hammock-strung beach bars create an aesthetic that's equal parts rustic and Instagrammable. There are no chains, no all-inclusives, and no mega-developments—just locally-owned hotels, restaurants, and a community committed to preserving the island's character. The bioluminescence in the lagoon (best June-October) is among the brightest in Mexico, creating magical night swims. While Holbox is no longer a hidden secret, it remains a place where the barefoot vibe is genuine, the water is impossibly shallow and warm, and the pace forces you to slow down. Bring cash, leave your schedule, and surrender to island time."

      "question": "Is Holbox expensive?",
      "answer": "Holbox is more expensive than mainland Mexico due to its popularity and logistics (everything comes by ferry).

It's worth the premium for the car-free paradise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Holbox safe?",

    {
      "question": "How many days should I spend on Holbox?",
      "answer": "3-4 days is ideal to fully experience the island pace: beach days, whale shark or bioluminescence tour (seasonal), sunset at Punta Cocos, and exploring downtown. Minimum 2 nights to justify the travel time. Many visitors extend their stay once they arrive."

    {
      "question": "Can I do Holbox as a day trip from Cancún?",
      "answer": "Technically possible but not recommended—you'd spend 5+ hours traveling for limited island time. Holbox deserves at least 2 nights to appreciate its magic. The journey is part of unplugging. Day-trippers miss sunset, bioluminescence, and the peaceful morning hours."
    },
    {
