    "snippet": "Sayulita is Mexico's most charming surf village—a kaleidoscope of color where jungle-covered hills meet gentle Pacific waves, cobblestone streets burst with street art and boutiques, and the vibe blends bohemian cool with authentic Mexican beach town soul. This Pueblo Mágico delivers beginner-friendly surfing, Huichol indigenous culture, and irresistible atmosphere.",
    "full": "Just 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, Sayulita has evolved from a sleepy fishing village into one of Mexico's most beloved beach destinations—yet it has managed to retain much of its original character. The town earned Pueblo Mágico (Magic Town) status for its cultural significance, and the magic is evident in every corner: from the colorful Day of the Dead decorations that adorn buildings year-round to the smell of fresh fish tacos and the sound of mariachis in the plaza.\n\nThe beach break at Sayulita is legendary among beginning surfers—consistent, forgiving waves that make learning a joy. Beyond surfing, the town offers world-class restaurants, trendy boutiques selling Huichol art and local designs, and a nightlife scene that ranges from mezcal bars to beach bonfires. The surrounding area includes hidden beaches like Playa de los Muertos, the whales-and-dolphins-rich waters of Bahía de Banderas, and the indigenous Huichol communities of the Sierra Madre.\n\nWhat makes Sayulita special is its perfect balance: developed enough for comfort yet funky enough for character. You'll find excellent espresso next to rustic taco stands, yoga retreats near surf shacks, and visiting celebrities mingling with local fishermen. Whether you're learning to surf, hunting for Huichol beadwork, or simply soaking up the bohemian vibes, Sayulita delivers Mexico's beach dream with an authentic heartbeat."

    {
      "question": "Is Sayulita good for beginner surfers?",
      "answer": "Sayulita is one of Mexico's best places to learn to surf. The main beach has a consistent, gentle break perfect for beginners with a sandy bottom that's forgiving when you fall. Multiple surf schools offer quality instruction, and you can easily stand up on your first lesson. More experienced surfers head to nearby breaks like La Lancha for bigger waves."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Sayulita from Puerto Vallarta?",
      "answer": "Sayulita is 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta Airport. Options include: rental car (easy, scenic drive on Highway 200), Uber/taxi ($60-80 USD one way), airport shuttle ($25-35 USD/person), or the local bus from Walmart in Puerto Vallarta ($2 USD, 1.5 hours). The bus is scenic and authentic but slower."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sayulita a good day trip from Puerto Vallarta?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—it's one of the most popular day trips. You can surf, explore the colorful streets, have lunch, shop for Huichol art, and return in a full day. However, staying overnight lets you experience sunset beach drinks, morning surf sessions, and the town's nightlife. Many visitors wish they'd stayed longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sayulita crowded?",
      "answer": "Sayulita is popular and can feel crowded, especially on weekends, Mexican holidays, and during peak season (December-April). For a quieter experience, visit midweek, explore neighboring San Pancho, or catch early morning surf sessions before day-trippers arrive. Summer is less crowded but can be hot and rainy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sayulita expensive?",
      "answer": "Sayulita is mid-range for Mexican beach towns—more expensive than Puerto Escondido or Zipolite but less than Tulum or Cabo. Budget travelers can find hostels ($15-30/night) and street food ($2-5/meal). Boutique hotels run $100-200/night. Fine dining is $20-40/person. It's reasonable by international beach town standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sayulita safe?",
      "answer": "Sayulita is very safe for tourists. The small-town community relies on tourism and takes security seriously. Violent crime against tourists is essentially unheard of. Normal precautions apply: don't leave valuables unattended at the beach, avoid isolated areas late at night. The main dangers are sunburn and strong ocean currents."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Huichol art and where can I buy it?",
      "answer": "The Huichol (Wixáritari) people from the Sierra Madre mountains create stunning beaded sculptures and yarn paintings depicting spiritual visions and traditional symbols. Sayulita has many galleries and street vendors selling authentic work. Buy directly from Huichol artisans for fair prices and genuine pieces—look for artists in traditional dress near the plaza."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time to visit Sayulita?",
      "answer": "November to April offers the best weather: dry, warm days (26°C/79°F), and consistent surf. December-January is peak season with higher prices and crowds. Summer (June-September) brings afternoon rain, warmer water, fewer tourists, and lower prices—but surf can be flat and some restaurants close. Whale watching is December-March."
