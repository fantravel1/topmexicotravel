    "snippet": "Sayulita is Mexico's most charming surf village—a kaleidoscope of color where jungle-covered hills meet gentle Pacific waves, cobblestone streets burst with street art and boutiques, and the vibe blends bohemian cool with authentic Mexican beach town soul. This Pueblo Mágico delivers beginner-friendly surfing and irresistible atmosphere.",
    "full": "Just 45 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, Sayulita has evolved from a sleepy fishing village into one of Mexico's most beloved beach destinations—yet it has managed to retain much of its original character. The town earned Pueblo Mágico (Magic Town) status for its cultural significance, and the magic is evident in every corner: from the colorful Day of the Dead decorations that adorn buildings year-round to the smell of fresh fish tacos and the sound of mariachis in the plaza.\n\nThe beach break at Sayulita is legendary among beginning surfers—consistent, forgiving waves that make learning a joy. Beyond surfing, the town offers world-class restaurants, trendy boutiques selling Huichol art and local designs, and a nightlife scene that ranges from mezcal bars to beach bonfires. The surrounding area includes hidden beaches like Playa de los Muertos, the whales-and-dolphins-rich waters of Bahía de Banderas, and the indigenous Huichol communities of the Sierra Madre. Sayulita is Instagram-ready but authentically alive—a place where the cliché of Mexican beach paradise actually delivers."
