  "introduction": "Maroma Beach has been repeatedly voted one of the world's most beautiful beaches—and Secrets secured prime real estate. The adults-only resort combines AMResorts' polished formula with this exceptional beach, creating something special: reliable luxury where the natural setting does the heavy lifting. Waves lap gently on powdery white sand, palm trees provide natural shade, and the Caribbean shows off its impossible blues. The resort is excellent; the beach is extraordinary.",

    {
      "question": "Is Maroma Beach really as good as they say?",
      "answer": "Yes—it's genuinely one of Mexico's best beaches. The protected cove creates calm, clear water ideal for swimming. The sand is powder-white, the palms are picturesque, and the overall setting is exceptional. The beach alone justifies choosing this Secrets over others."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Secrets Maroma compare to other Secrets properties?",
      "answer": "Maroma wins on beach quality—no other Secrets property matches it. Secrets Moxché is newer, Secrets The Vine has Hotel Zone access, and Secrets Riviera Cancún is larger. But if beach is your priority, Maroma is the clear choice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need Preferred Club for a good beach experience?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. PC guarantees beach bed access, but early risers get beds anyway. If you're planning to sleep in and still want prime beach spots, PC helps. If you're up by 8am, standard experience is fine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Secrets Maroma good for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Excellent choice. The beach is romantic, swim-out suites are special, and the adults-only atmosphere is sophisticated. It's not the most intimate property (400+ suites), but the setting and service deliver for honeymoons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about seaweed at Maroma Beach?",
      "answer": "The protected cove helps reduce seaweed accumulation compared to open beaches. It's not immune—sargassum can appear anywhere in the Caribbean—but Maroma typically fares better. Check recent reviews for current conditions."
