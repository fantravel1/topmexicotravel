      "question": "Are all-inclusives worth it in Mexico?",
      "answer": "For many travelers, yes. The value comes from not thinking about money on vacation—everything is paid for. They work best for relaxation-focused trips, families (predictable costs), and those who want drinks included. They're less ideal for adventurous travelers who want to explore extensively."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is the best all-inclusive in Mexico?",
      "answer": "It depends on your priorities. For overall luxury: Grand Velas. For adults-only romance: Excellence or Secrets. For families: Dreams or Hyatt Ziva. For party scene: Breathless or Hard Rock. For food: UNICO 20°87° or Grand Velas. For value: RIU or Iberostar mid-range."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I budget for an all-inclusive Mexico trip?",
      "answer": "For a couple (7 nights): Budget tier $2,000-3,000; Mid-range $3,500-5,000; Premium $5,000-8,000; Luxury $8,000-15,000. Add flights ($300-800/person) and transfers ($100-200/couple). Build in $500-1,000 for excursions and spa."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the food at all-inclusives any good?",
      "answer": "It varies dramatically by tier. Budget resorts have mediocre buffets. Mid-range is decent. Premium and luxury resorts often have genuinely excellent restaurants that would be successful standalone. Grand Velas, Excellence, and UNICO are known for outstanding food."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tip at an all-inclusive resort?",
      "answer": "Even when \"tips included,\" discretionary tipping improves service. Carry $1-2 bills for bartenders and housekeeping. $5-10 for exceptional restaurant service. Tip pool/beach attendants for prime spots. Budget $50-100 total for a week."
