    {
      "question": "Which tier gives the best value for money?",
      "answer": "Top Shelf tier typically delivers the best value—you're getting 80-90% of the Elite experience at 50-60% of the price. The jump from Mainstream to Top Shelf is noticeable in food, drinks, and service. The jump from Top Shelf to Elite is smaller relative to the cost increase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can budget all-inclusives really be enjoyable?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—with calibrated expectations. You're getting beach, pool, unlimited food and drinks, and entertainment. The food won't be gourmet, drinks won't be premium, and rooms won't be luxurious. But if your goal is an affordable beach vacation without counting costs, Bargain tier delivers real value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the biggest difference between Elite and Top Shelf?",
      "answer": "Butler/host service and consistently premium drinks. Elite properties include truly premium spirits (Clase Azul, Don Julio 1942) as standard—Top Shelf usually caps at mid-premium (Patrón Silver, Herradura). Elite also has more personalized service with staff anticipating needs rather than just responding to requests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Oldie but Goodie resorts dated and rundown?",
      "answer": "Most have been renovated multiple times—they're not operating with 1997 furniture. What they offer is established landscaping (mature palms, gardens), refined service systems, and staff who've been with the property for decades. They often feel more authentic than cookie-cutter new builds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth upgrading from Mainstream to Top Shelf?",
      "answer": "If food and drink quality matter to you, yes. The upgrade typically adds $150-250/night but transforms the dining and drinking experience. If you mainly want beach time and don't care about premium liquor or creative cuisine, save your money."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which tier is best for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Top Shelf or Elite adults-only properties deliver the best honeymoon experience. Secrets, Excellence, and El Dorado specialize in romance without being over-the-top. Elite tier adds butler service for those wanting extra pampering. Celebrity/VIP is for unlimited budgets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tier should families with kids choose?",
      "answer": "Mainstream tier offers the best family value with extensive kids' programming (Dreams, Hyatt Ziva, Iberostar). Top Shelf options like Dreams Natura add premium touches. Elite family options (Grand Velas family section) exist for those wanting luxury + kids."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do higher tiers actually have better beaches?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, but not always. Some Bargain properties have excellent beaches while some Elite properties have seaweed issues. Research specific beach conditions through recent reviews. Resort tier determines service and amenities—beach quality is mostly luck of location and season."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if a resort really belongs in its tier?",
      "answer": "Look at recent reviews mentioning food quality, drink brands served, room condition, and service responsiveness. A resort charging Elite prices with Mainstream reviews is overcharging. Properties genuinely deserving their tier will have reviews validating the experience matches the price."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum number of nights to justify higher tiers?",
      "answer": "For Top Shelf and Elite, 4+ nights lets you experience the full dining rotation and amenities. For Celebrity/VIP, 3 nights minimum (these are experiences, not just accommodations). Bargain and Mainstream work fine for quick 3-night escapes."
