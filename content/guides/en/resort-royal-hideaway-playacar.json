  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is 200 rooms too small?",
      "answer": "It's a feature, not a bug. 200 rooms means uncrowded beaches, available restaurant seating, staff who learn your preferences, and genuine intimacy. If you want mega-resort amenities, look elsewhere. If you want romantic atmosphere, the size is perfect."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Royal Hideaway compare to newer adults-only resorts?",
      "answer": "Newer resorts have more modern design and sometimes better amenities. Royal Hideaway has character, established landscaping, refined service, and the intimate scale that new properties struggle to achieve. It's classic versus contemporary—choose based on preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the walk to Playa del Carmen actually feasible?",
      "answer": "Yes—15-20 minutes to Fifth Avenue. It's a pleasant walk through Playacar. Many couples walk to dinner in Playa for variety. Taxis are also readily available. The accessibility to real town life is a genuine advantage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Royal Hideaway good for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Excellent choice for couples who value intimacy over flashiness. The romantic focus is genuine, private dinners are available, and the atmosphere is sophisticated without being kitschy. Communicate your honeymoon status for extra touches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do couples keep returning year after year?",
      "answer": "The combination of intimacy, walkable location, and established quality creates loyalty. Staff remember returning guests, the formula works reliably, and the peaceful atmosphere is hard to find at larger properties. It becomes 'their place.'"
