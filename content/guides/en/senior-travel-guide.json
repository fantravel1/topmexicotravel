    {
      "question": "Is Mexico safe for senior travelers?",
      "answer": "Yes, tourist areas are safe. Seniors are treated with respect in Mexican culture. Use the same precautions as any destination: stay in tourist areas, use safe transportation (Uber), don't flash valuables. Medical facilities in tourist areas are good."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about healthcare and medications?",
      "answer": "Bring enough medication for your entire trip plus extra. Carry prescriptions with generic names. Mexican pharmacies can fill many medications without US prescription (but bring yours anyway). Private hospitals are excellent—travel insurance is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will altitude affect me?",
      "answer": "Possibly. Mexico City (7,350 ft), San Miguel (6,200 ft), and other highland destinations may cause fatigue, shortness of breath, or headaches initially. Take it easy the first 1-2 days, drink lots of water, limit alcohol. Beach destinations have no altitude issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get around with limited mobility?",
      "answer": "It depends on the destination. All-inclusive resorts and modern areas are accessible. Colonial cities have cobblestones and stairs. Archaeological sites involve uneven ground. Choose destinations carefully, book accessible accommodations, and consider private tours with flexible pacing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I plan to walk?",
      "answer": "This varies by destination and style. Colonial cities require walking on uneven surfaces. All-inclusive resorts can be navigated with minimal walking. Private tours let you control walking distances. Be honest about your abilities when planning and choosing activities."
