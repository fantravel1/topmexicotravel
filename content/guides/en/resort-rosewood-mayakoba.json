  "introduction": "Rosewood Mayakoba redefined what a Caribbean resort could be. Rather than clearing jungle for ocean views, they built within it—creating a labyrinth of lagoons, mangroves, and private suites accessible by boat. The result is a property where howler monkeys are your morning alarm, exotic birds fill the canopy, and your private plunge pool overlooks primordial waterways. This isn't a beach resort with nature nearby; it's a nature reserve that happens to have a beach.",

    {
      "question": "Is the seaweed situation at Rosewood Mayakoba bad?",
      "answer": "It varies by season and year. The resort employs a full-time beach maintenance team, but during peak sargassum season (often March-August), the beach can be affected. The lagoon, pools, and cenote excursions are unaffected. Check recent reviews for current conditions before booking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the mosquitoes and insects really a problem?",
      "answer": "It's a jungle—insects are part of the ecosystem. The resort manages them well, and most guests adjust quickly. Bring repellent, wear long pants at evening, and you'll be fine. The tradeoff is howler monkeys, exotic birds, and a setting unlike any other resort."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does boat transportation work?",
      "answer": "Boats operate continuously throughout the day and evening. Call from your suite and one arrives within 5-10 minutes. It's a magical way to travel the property, watching wildlife en route. Walking paths exist too if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Rosewood Mayakoba good for families?",
      "answer": "Excellent for families who appreciate nature and can afford it. The two-bedroom suites work well, kids love the wildlife and boat rides, and the Rose Buds program is solid. It's not a kids' activity resort though—don't expect water slides."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I choose Rosewood or stay at another Mayakoba property?",
      "answer": "Rosewood is the most refined and nature-integrated option. Banyan Tree is more intimate with outstanding villas. Fairmont is family-focused with more amenities. Andaz is newest and most design-forward. All share golf and can cross-dine. Rosewood guests generally don't feel the need to explore other properties."
