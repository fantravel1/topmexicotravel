  "introduction": "Mexico offers some of the world's most incredible whale encounters. Gray whales travel 5,000 miles to birth their calves in Baja's warm lagoons—and actively approach boats for interaction. Humpbacks perform acrobatic displays off Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos. Whale sharks—the ocean's gentle giants—gather in massive congregations near Holbox and La Paz. This guide covers every species, location, and season.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you really touch gray whales?",
      "answer": "Yes—but only when they approach you. Gray whales in Baja's lagoons frequently swim to boats and surface beside them, sometimes allowing (seemingly inviting) gentle touches. This is wild animal behavior you cannot force; ethical operators let whales make the choice. When it happens, it's extraordinary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is swimming with whale sharks safe?",
      "answer": "Completely safe. Whale sharks are filter feeders eating only plankton—they have no interest in humans as food. Their mouths are large but their throats are small. The main caution is avoiding accidental contact with their powerful tail. Follow your guide's instructions and maintain distance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I get seasick?",
      "answer": "Take motion sickness medication (Dramamine, Bonine) 30-60 minutes before departure. Ginger supplements help some people. Choose calm-water options when possible (lagoons are calmer than open ocean). Sit near the center of the boat, look at the horizon, and avoid strong smells."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which experience is best for families with kids?",
      "answer": "Gray whales in Baja work well for ages 6+ (boat rides aren't too long, close encounters thrill kids). Whale sharks require swimming ability and comfort in open water—better for teens. Humpback watching works for all ages but younger kids may lose patience during searching periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we don't see any whales?",
      "answer": "During peak season with reputable operators, this is rare but possible. Gray whale lagoon trips almost always produce encounters. Humpback trips occasionally come up empty (10-15% chance at peak). Whale shark trips depend on animal movements—reputable operators refund or rebook if no sightings."
