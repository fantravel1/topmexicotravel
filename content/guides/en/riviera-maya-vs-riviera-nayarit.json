  "introduction": "Mexico claims two Rivieras—and they couldn't be more different. The Riviera Maya stretches south from Cancun along the Caribbean, delivering turquoise water, ancient ruins, and all-inclusive mega-resorts. The Riviera Nayarit hugs the Pacific north of Puerto Vallarta, offering surf towns, jungle mountains, and a more authentic Mexican beach experience. Same country, different oceans, completely different vibes. This comparison helps you choose the right coast for your vacation.",

      "title": "Final Verdict",
      "content": "**Riviera Maya** is Mexico's most developed beach destination for good reason—the Caribbean color is stunning, the cenotes are unlike anywhere else on Earth, and the Mayan ruins add cultural depth that pure beach destinations lack. All-inclusive resorts make vacationing effortless. The tradeoffs are higher prices, crowds, and a sometimes-too-polished feel that masks Mexican authenticity.\n\n**Riviera Nayarit** is the Pacific alternative for travelers seeking a more authentic Mexican beach experience. Surf culture, small towns, whale watching, and dramatic mountain-meets-ocean scenery create a different vibe entirely. It's cheaper, less crowded, and rewards independent exploration. The tradeoff is less dramatic water color and less all-inclusive infrastructure.\n\n**The Simple Decision:**\n- **Caribbean bucket list:** Riviera Maya\n- **Surf trip:** Riviera Nayarit\n- **All-inclusive vacation:** Riviera Maya\n- **Boutique/independent travel:** Riviera Nayarit\n- **Ancient ruins:** Riviera Maya\n- **Whale watching:** Riviera Nayarit\n- **Instagram water photos:** Riviera Maya\n- **Better value:** Riviera Nayarit\n- **First time to Mexico:** Riviera Maya\n- **Return visitor:** Riviera Nayarit\n\n**Our Recommendation:**\nIf you've never seen the Caribbean side of Mexico, the Riviera Maya is essential—the cenotes and ruins are unique. But for travelers who've done Cancun/Playa/Tulum, or anyone seeking surf culture and authentic Mexican beach life, Riviera Nayarit delivers a refreshingly different experience."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which has better water for swimming—Riviera Maya or Riviera Nayarit?",
      "answer": "Riviera Maya has calmer, warmer Caribbean water that's generally better for casual swimming and snorkeling. Riviera Nayarit's Pacific has more waves (great for surfing, less ideal for floating). However, Banderas Bay around Puerto Vallarta and Nuevo Vallarta has protected calm water. The Caribbean is more consistently swim-friendly; the Pacific varies by beach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth visiting both Rivieras in one trip?",
      "answer": "They're on opposite coasts, so combining them requires internal flights (2+ hours, $150-300). If you have 10+ days, it's possible but involves significant travel time. Most travelers choose one per trip. If you must combine ocean coasts in one trip, consider flying into one and out of the other."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is better for families—Riviera Maya or Riviera Nayarit?",
      "answer": "Riviera Maya is generally easier for families due to more all-inclusive options with kids' clubs, calmer swimming water, and more organized activities. However, families seeking authentic beach town experience (vs resort bubble) may prefer Riviera Nayarit—places like Bucerias are family-friendly and more culturally immersive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better surfing—Riviera Maya or Riviera Nayarit?",
      "answer": "Riviera Nayarit, definitively. The Caribbean side has almost no surf—it's a reef-protected coast. Riviera Nayarit has multiple breaks from beginner (Sayulita) to advanced (Punta Mita), with consistent Pacific swells. If surfing is any part of your plan, choose the Pacific coast."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which coast has more authentic Mexican culture?",
      "answer": "Riviera Nayarit feels more authentically Mexican—smaller towns, more Mexican domestic tourists, less English spoken, and beach culture that hasn't been as modified for international tourism. Riviera Maya can feel like a tourist enclave where Spanish is optional. Both have authentic pockets, but Riviera Nayarit is less filtered."
