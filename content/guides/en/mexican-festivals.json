    {
      "question": "What is Mexico's biggest holiday?",
      "answer": "Independence Day (September 15-16) and Day of the Dead (November 1-2) are the two biggest celebrations. Independence Day is more universally celebrated with parties and patriotism, while Day of the Dead is more culturally significant and varies by region. Semana Santa (Easter week) causes the biggest travel disruption as the entire country goes on vacation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cinco de Mayo a big deal in Mexico?",
      "answer": "No! Cinco de Mayo is much bigger in the United States than in Mexico. It commemorates a battle victory in 1862 and is mainly celebrated in Puebla state. It's not even a national holiday—banks and businesses stay open. Mexican Independence Day is September 16, not May 5."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I avoid traveling to Mexico?",
      "answer": "Avoid Semana Santa (Easter week) unless you want crowds and premium prices—the entire country vacations at once. Christmas through New Year is busy and expensive at resorts. These are great times to visit if you embrace the festivity, but terrible for budget travelers or those seeking solitude."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best festival to experience Mexican culture?",
      "answer": "Day of the Dead in Oaxaca or Pátzcuaro offers the deepest cultural immersion—you witness ancient traditions honoring ancestors with altars, vigils, and celebrations. Guelaguetza (July, Oaxaca) showcases indigenous culture through dance and music. Independence Day captures Mexican patriotism and party spirit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far ahead should I book for Day of the Dead?",
      "answer": "Book hotels 6+ months ahead for Oaxaca or Pátzcuaro during Day of the Dead (late October-early November). This is peak season with peak prices. Flights also fill up. Even Mexico City hotels near cemeteries book out. It's Mexico's most popular tourist event for a reason."
