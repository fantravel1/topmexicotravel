  "introduction": "Tipping in Mexico follows different rules than the US, Canada, or Europe—and the rules change depending on whether you're at an all-inclusive resort, a local taco stand, or a fine dining restaurant. This guide eliminates the guesswork so you can tip appropriately without anxiety or accidentally insulting anyone.",

      "title": "Tipping Fundamentals",
      "content": "**The Basics:**\n\n- Tipping is customary in Mexico but generally lower than US percentages\n- Service workers often earn minimum wage (~$15 USD/day), so tips matter\n- Cash tips are preferred—they go directly to the worker\n- Pesos preferred, but US dollars accepted in tourist areas\n- \"Propina\" is Spanish for tip\n\n**Pesos vs Dollars:**\n\n**Use Pesos When:**\n- At local restaurants and street food\n- For taxi drivers\n- At non-tourist businesses\n- For small tips (porters, housekeeping)\n- When you want the worker to get full value\n\n**Dollars Acceptable When:**\n- At all-inclusive resorts\n- In heavily touristed areas (Cancún, Cabo)\n- For tour guides\n- When you don't have pesos available\n\n**Exchange Rate Awareness:**\nAt roughly 17 pesos = $1 USD, a $1 tip equals about 17 pesos. A 50-peso tip equals about $3 USD. Know the rough rate so you don't over or under-tip."

    {
      "question": "Do I really need to tip at all-inclusive resorts?",
      "answer": "Technically no—gratuities are included in your rate. But those pooled tips don't always reach workers directly, and cash tips improve your service noticeably. Budget $15-30 USD/day for tips, and you'll have better drinks, faster service, and premium beach chairs mysteriously appearing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tip in pesos or dollars?",
      "answer": "Pesos are preferred at local establishments and ensure workers get full value without exchange hassles. US dollars are fine at resorts and tourist areas—$1 bills are basically universal in Cancún and Cabo. When in doubt, pesos show cultural awareness and are always appreciated."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if service is really bad—do I still tip?",
      "answer": "Yes, reduce the tip to 5-10% but still leave something. Service workers earn very low base wages. Address serious issues with management separately. The exception: genuinely offensive or inappropriate behavior warrants no tip and a complaint."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I tip if I'm paying by credit card?",
      "answer": "You can write the tip on the receipt, but cash is always preferred—it goes directly to the worker without delay or potential skimming. Best approach: pay bill on card, leave cash tip on table. Second best: add tip to card receipt."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it true grocery baggers work only for tips?",
      "answer": "Yes—in most Mexican supermarkets, baggers (often elderly or students) receive no salary and work entirely for tips. Always tip 10-20 pesos per bag or more for large loads. This is one tip you should never skip."
