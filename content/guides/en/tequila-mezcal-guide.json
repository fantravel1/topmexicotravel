      "title": "Tequila vs. Mezcal: What's the Difference?",
      "content": "**The Simple Answer:**\nAll tequila is mezcal, but not all mezcal is tequila. Mezcal is the broader category—any spirit distilled from agave. Tequila is a specific type of mezcal with strict regulations.\n\n**Tequila:**\n- Made ONLY from blue Weber agave\n- Produced only in designated regions (primarily Jalisco)\n- Usually cooked in ovens (industrial or brick)\n- Cleaner, often sweeter flavor profile\n- Heavily regulated denomination of origin\n\n**Mezcal:**\n- Can be made from 40+ agave varieties\n- Primarily from Oaxaca (but 9 states allowed)\n- Traditionally cooked in underground pits (smoky flavor)\n- More diverse, artisanal, often smokier\n- Less industrial, more small-batch production\n\n**Flavor Profiles:**\n- **Tequila:** Bright, peppery, citrus notes, agave sweetness\n- **Mezcal:** Smoky, complex, earthy, vegetal, can be fruity or mineral\n\n**The Saying:**\n\"Tequila is to mezcal as bourbon is to whiskey\"—a specific, regulated subset of a broader category."

      "content": "**Classifications:**\n\n**By Aging:**\n- **Blanco (Silver/Plata):** Unaged or <2 months. Pure agave flavor. Best for cocktails and purists.\n- **Reposado:** Aged 2-12 months in oak. Mellower, hints of vanilla/caramel. Versatile.\n- **Añejo:** Aged 1-3 years. Smooth, complex, whiskey-like. Sipping tequila.\n- **Extra Añejo:** Aged 3+ years. Ultra-smooth, luxury category.\n- **Joven/Gold:** Usually blanco with coloring/flavoring added. Avoid for quality.\n\n**By Composition:**\n- **100% Agave:** Only blue agave, no added sugars. Always look for this.\n- **Mixto:** 51% agave, 49% other sugars. Lower quality, causes worse hangovers.\n\n**Production Regions:**\n- **Jalisco:** Primary region, includes Tequila town\n- **Highlands (Los Altos):** Sweeter, fruitier agave\n- **Lowlands (Tequila Valley):** Earthier, more herbaceous\n- Also: Parts of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, Tamaulipas\n\n**Quality Indicators:**\n- \"100% de Agave\" on label (required)\n- NOM number (distillery registration)\n- CRT certification seal\n- Avoid anything under $20 (likely mixto or fake)"

      "content": "**Classifications:**\n\n**By Production Method:**\n- **Ancestral:** Most traditional. Cooked in pits, crushed by tahona (stone wheel), clay pot distillation. Rare, expensive.\n- **Artesanal:** Traditional but may use copper stills. Still small-batch, quality-focused.\n- **Mezcal (Industrial):** Modern equipment allowed. Mass production possible.\n\n**By Aging:**\n- **Joven:** Unaged. Most common. Shows agave character.\n- **Reposado:** Aged 2-12 months.\n- **Añejo:** Aged 1+ years.\n- **Madurado en Vidrio:** Rested in glass (doesn't change flavor, stabilizes).\n\n**Agave Varieties:**\n- **Espadín:** Most common (90% of mezcal). Reliable, approachable.\n- **Tobalá:** Wild, rare. Complex, floral.\n- **Madrecuixe:** Wild. Herbaceous, long finish.\n- **Tepeztate:** Takes 25+ years to mature. Intense, complex.\n- **Arroqueño:** Large, dramatic. Earthy, chocolatey.\n- **Cuishe:** Mineral, citrusy.\n\n**Regional Variations:**\n- **Oaxaca:** 85%+ of mezcal. Most diverse.\n- **Durango:** Growing region, distinct character.\n- **Guerrero:** Historic, less commercial.\n- **San Luis Potosí, Puebla, others:** Emerging."

      "title": "How to Taste Like a Pro",
      "content": "**The Right Glass:**\n- **Veladora:** Traditional votive candle holder (yes, really). Opens up aromas.\n- **Copita:** Small clay cup, traditional for mezcal.\n- **Wine glass or snifter:** Works well for nosing.\n- **NOT a shot glass:** You're tasting, not shooting.\n\n**Tasting Steps:**\n\n1. **Look:** Hold up to light. Note color (blanco should be clear, aged will be golden). Swirl—good tequila has \"legs\" (viscosity).\n\n2. **Smell (First Nose):** Gentle sniff from distance. Notice initial aromas—agave, fruit, spice, smoke (mezcal).\n\n3. **Smell (Second Nose):** Bring closer, open mouth slightly. Get deeper aromas. What do you detect?\n\n4. **Taste:** Small sip. Let it coat your mouth. Notice sweetness, heat, flavors. Swallow and note the finish.\n\n5. **Add Water (Optional):** A few drops can open up flavors, especially in high-proof mezcal.\n\n**Flavor Vocabulary:**\n- **Tequila:** Pepper, citrus, agave sweetness, vanilla (aged), caramel, herbs\n- **Mezcal:** Smoke, earth, ash, green pepper, tropical fruit, mineral, leather, chocolate\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Sip, don't shoot (you miss everything)\n- No lime and salt needed for quality tequila\n- Orange with sal de gusano (worm salt) for mezcal\n- Drink slowly—these are sipping spirits"

    {
      "question": "What's the worm in the bottle about?",
      "answer": "The worm (gusano) is a marketing gimmick from the 1950s, not a sign of quality or tradition. It's actually a moth larva that infests agave plants. Quality mezcal never has a worm. The practice was invented to differentiate brands and appeal to tourists. If you see a worm, it's generally a sign of lower-quality, tourist-targeted mezcal. Skip it and buy something better."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is good tequila expensive?",
      "answer": "Quality tequila requires blue agave that takes 7-10 years to mature. It's cooked slowly, fermented naturally, and distilled carefully. 100% agave tequila uses no cheap filler sugars. Añejos spend years aging in barrels. The production is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Cheap tequila uses younger plants, added sugars (mixto), and industrial shortcuts. You get what you pay for—quality tequila is worth the investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I drink mezcal?",
      "answer": "Sip it slowly from a wide glass (veladora or copita). Take small sips, letting it coat your mouth. Notice the smoke, fruit, earth, and complexity. Traditional accompaniments are orange slices and sal de gusano (worm salt with chile). Don't shoot it—you miss everything. Add a few drops of water to open up high-proof mezcals. It's a sipping spirit meant to be savored, not slammed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where's the best place for a tequila tour?",
      "answer": "Tequila, Jalisco—the town the spirit is named for. It's an hour from Guadalajara with dozens of distilleries, from giants like José Cuervo to artisanal producers like Fortaleza. The José Cuervo Express train from Guadalajara offers a full experience with tastings and entertainment. For serious enthusiasts, arrange visits to smaller, traditional producers. Stay overnight to visit multiple distilleries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is mezcal stronger than tequila?",
      "answer": "Often, but not always. Tequila is typically 35-40% ABV (70-80 proof). Mezcal ranges from 40-55% ABV, with some artisanal and ancestral mezcals reaching higher. The smokiness can also make mezcal seem more intense. However, the strength varies by producer. Always check the label. Higher proof mezcals benefit from a few drops of water to open up the flavors without the burn."
