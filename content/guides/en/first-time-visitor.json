      "question": "Do I need to speak Spanish?",
      "answer": "Not required in tourist areas—you can get by with English in hotels, restaurants, and attractions. However, basic Spanish phrases (hello, thank you, how much?) are appreciated and helpful. Outside tourist zones, Spanish becomes more useful. Download Google Translate with offline Spanish before your trip. Mexicans are patient and appreciate any effort to speak their language."

    {
      "question": "How much money should I bring?",
      "answer": "Mexico is affordable. Budget travelers can manage on $50-75/day (hostels, street food, local transport). Mid-range travelers spend $100-150/day (3-star hotels, nice restaurants, activities). Luxury travelers spend $300+/day. Bring a credit card for hotels and nice restaurants, plus cash for tacos, markets, and tips. ATMs give the best exchange rates."

      "answer": "For beach + ruins: Cancún/Riviera Maya offers easy resort experience with accessible Mayan sites. For culture + food: Mexico City has world-class museums, incredible cuisine, and vibrant neighborhoods. For beach + charm: Puerto Vallarta combines beautiful beaches with a walkable downtown.
