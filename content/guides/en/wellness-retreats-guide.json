      "question": "Do I need yoga experience for a retreat?",
      "answer": "Most retreats welcome all levels. Beginner-friendly options are abundant, especially in Tulum. Some advanced retreats or teacher trainings require experience. Always check the level specified and communicate your experience honestly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I pack for a wellness trip?",
      "answer": "Comfortable yoga/movement clothes, light layers, swimsuit (for cenotes and spas), journal, comfortable sandals, reef-safe sunscreen, water bottle, and minimal electronics. Most wellness retreats encourage packing light and disconnecting from devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are temazcal ceremonies safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, when properly facilitated. Communicate any health conditions (heart issues, pregnancy, claustrophobia). Stay hydrated, listen to your body, and feel free to exit if needed. Choose experienced facilitators. It's intense but not dangerous for healthy individuals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about plant medicine ceremonies in Mexico?",
      "answer": "They exist but approach carefully. This is not for beginners. Facilitator quality varies dramatically. Medical contraindications are real. It's a legal gray area. If interested, research extensively, start with gentler practices (cacao, breathwork), and ensure proper integration support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do wellness activities independently or do I need a retreat?",
      "answer": "Both work. Tulum has abundant drop-in classes and day experiences. You can create your own wellness itinerary at yoga-friendly hotels. Retreats offer structure and community, which helps some people commit. Independent is more flexible; retreats are more immersive."
