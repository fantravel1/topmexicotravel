    {
      "question": "Is it expensive to have a destination wedding in Mexico?",
      "answer": "It can be very affordable. A simple ceremony at an all-inclusive resort can cost $5,000-10,000. Mexico generally costs 30-50% less than comparable US weddings, and your guests get a vacation. Luxury options exist at every price point."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to get legally married in Mexico?",
      "answer": "No. Many couples get legally married at home (quick courthouse ceremony) and then have a symbolic ceremony in Mexico. This avoids the paperwork hassle while giving you the beautiful celebration you want."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best month for a wedding in Mexico?",
      "answer": "November through April offers the best weather nearly everywhere. February and March are particularly popular. Avoid September-October on the Caribbean coast (hurricane season) and June-September on the Pacific (rainy season)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book?",
      "answer": "12-18 months for popular venues and dates. 6-9 months is possible but limits options. High season (December-April) and Saturday dates book earliest. Weekday weddings have more availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wedding planner?",
      "answer": "Highly recommended. A local planner knows vendors, navigates language/cultural differences, handles logistics, and ensures legal requirements are met. Resort coordinators handle basics but outside planners offer more customization."
