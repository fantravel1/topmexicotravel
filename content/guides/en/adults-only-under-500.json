  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are adults-only resorts under $500 actually good?",
      "answer": "Yes—several deliver excellent value. The main differences from $800+ resorts: smaller rooms, fewer gourmet restaurants, and mid-shelf spirits. The beach, pools, and adults-only atmosphere are often comparable. You're sacrificing some luxury, not the experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cheapest time to book adults-only all-inclusive?",
      "answer": "May-June offers the best combination of low prices and good weather. September-October is cheapest but carries hurricane risk. November provides shoulder-season value before holiday pricing kicks in. Expect to pay 30-40% less than winter peak rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are drinks quality lower at budget resorts?",
      "answer": "Generally yes—you'll get mid-shelf spirits rather than premium brands. Quality varies: some properties (like Catalonia) include decent wines; others stick to basic pours. If premium cocktails matter, budget $20-30/day for upgraded drinks, or choose Catalonia Royal for better inclusions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a swim-out suite under $500/night?",
      "answer": "Yes—Barceló Maya Riviera, Ocean Riviera Paradise, and Margaritaville all offer swim-outs in the $400-500 range. During low season, you might find them under $400. These represent exceptional value—swim-outs at Secrets or Excellence cost $1,000+."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which budget adults-only resort is best for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Sunscape Akumal for unique romance (sea turtles, intimate beach) or Catalonia Royal Tulum for food-focused couples. Both create romantic experiences without the premium price. Consider Barceló Maya Riviera if you want swim-out luxury at budget prices."
