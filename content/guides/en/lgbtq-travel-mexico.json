      "question": "Is Mexico safe for LGBTQ+ travelers?",
      "answer": "Yes, in tourist areas and major cities. Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancún, and Oaxaca are welcoming destinations with active LGBTQ+ communities and legal protections. Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide. Use common sense—gay neighborhoods are openly welcoming, while more conservative areas warrant discretion. Overall, LGBTQ+ travelers report positive experiences, especially in established gay-friendly destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best gay destination in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Puerto Vallarta for beach and concentrated gay scene (Zona Romántica has 30+ gay venues in a compact area). Mexico City for culture, nightlife variety, and Latin America's largest Pride. PV is more resort-oriented and relaxed; CDMX offers urban sophistication and cultural experiences. Many travelers do both—they're very different experiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can same-sex couples get married in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Yes! Same-sex marriage is legal throughout Mexico (nationwide since 2022, earlier in many states). Puerto Vallarta is the most popular gay wedding destination, with many venues specializing in same-sex ceremonies. You'll need passports, birth certificates, blood tests, and a few days' residency. Work with a local wedding planner to navigate paperwork smoothly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a lesbian scene in Mexico?",
      "answer": "The lesbian scene is smaller and less visible than the gay male scene, but it exists. Mexico City has dedicated spaces like Lollipop bar, plus mixed venues popular with queer women. Facebook groups and Meetup help connect with local community. Puerto Vallarta is welcoming but has fewer dedicated women's spaces. Connect online before your trip to find events and meetups."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is Mexico City Pride?",
      "answer": "The last Saturday of June, coinciding with international Pride month. It's one of Latin America's largest Pride celebrations, with over a million attendees. The parade runs from the Ángel de la Independencia monument to the Zócalo. A full week of events includes parties, cultural programming, and activism. Book hotels months in advance—the city fills up."
