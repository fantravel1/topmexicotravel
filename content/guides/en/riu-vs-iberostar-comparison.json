      "content": "**RIU** is the reliable workhorse—affordable, consistent, and packed with value. Properties vary in quality and vibe, but you know what you're getting: plenty of food, drinks, and activities without breaking the bank. The in-room liquor dispenser and 24-hour everything make it particularly appealing for guests who want maximum flexibility. Best for budget-conscious travelers, first-timers, and those who want straightforward all-inclusive experiences.\n\n**Iberostar** delivers a more refined version of the same concept—slightly better rooms, marginally better food, and noticeably better sustainability practices. The Wave of Change environmental program sets it apart for eco-conscious travelers, and the Grand tier offers genuine premium experiences. Best for guests who'll pay a bit more for quality improvements, repeat all-inclusive travelers, and anyone who values environmental responsibility.\n\n**The Simple Decision:**\n- **Maximum value:** RIU\n- **Better quality:** Iberostar\n- **Party atmosphere:** RIU\n- **Refined atmosphere:** Iberostar\n- **Best adults-only (budget):** RIU Palace Peninsula\n- **Best adults-only (premium):** Iberostar Grand Paraíso\n- **Best family (budget):** RIU Palace Costa Mujeres\n- **Best family (premium):** Iberostar Selection Cancún\n\nNeither chain will disappoint for their category—it's about matching your priorities to the right brand."

      "question": "Is RIU or Iberostar better for families?",
      "answer": "Both work well for families, but with different strengths. RIU offers more properties and better value, with kids' clubs and water parks at select locations. Iberostar provides a slightly more refined family experience with better dining. For budget families: RIU. For families prioritizing quality: Iberostar Selection properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which chain has better food—RIU or Iberostar?",
      "answer": "Iberostar edges ahead on food quality and presentation, though the difference isn't dramatic. RIU offers more 24-hour dining options and the unique in-room liquor dispenser. For foodies, Iberostar Selection or Grand tier restaurants deliver more satisfying experiences. For quantity and convenience, RIU wins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are RIU Palace properties worth the upgrade?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially for couples and adults-only seekers. RIU Palace properties offer noticeably better rooms, dining, and atmosphere for typically $100-150/night more than standard RIU. The upgrade from basic RIU to Palace is more significant than upgrading from RIU Palace to Iberostar Selection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is more environmentally responsible—RIU or Iberostar?",
      "answer": "Iberostar, definitively. Their Wave of Change program includes coral nurseries, marine biologists on staff, plastic-free initiatives, and guest participation in reef restoration. It's not just marketing—guests can see and participate in conservation efforts. RIU has standard resort sustainability practices but nothing comparable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I visit multiple RIU or Iberostar properties during my stay?",
      "answer": "Both chains offer exchange privileges between nearby sister properties. RIU's exchange is called 'RIU Get Together' in Playacar (5 properties). Iberostar's Paraíso complex in Riviera Maya allows access to multiple properties. Check specific availability when booking, as policies vary by property and season."
