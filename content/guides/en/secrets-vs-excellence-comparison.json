      "question": "Which is better for honeymoons—Secrets or Excellence?",
      "answer": "Both excel at honeymoons, but Excellence edges ahead for couples wanting intimacy and romance. Excellence Playa Mujeres has better suites and a more refined atmosphere. However, Secrets Maroma's beach is unmatched—if beach quality is your priority, it's a strong choice. Both include honeymoon perks; Excellence's tend to be slightly better."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Excellence worth the extra cost over Secrets?",
      "answer": "If suite quality and beach experience are priorities, yes. You'll pay 10-15% more for noticeably better accommodations and typically superior beach locations. If you're primarily interested in dining variety and social atmosphere, Secrets offers excellent value and the savings can fund spa treatments or excursions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you walk off property at these resorts?",
      "answer": "Only Secrets The Vine (Cancún Hotel Zone) has meaningful walkable surroundings. All other Secrets and Excellence properties are self-contained—you're committing to the resort experience. This isn't a negative; it's by design. Both chains create comprehensive experiences that don't require leaving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better food—Secrets or Excellence?",
      "answer": "Excellence has higher culinary ambitions, particularly at their signature Lobster House. Secrets offers more variety with more restaurants per property. For most guests, both deliver satisfying all-inclusive dining. Foodies lean toward Excellence; those wanting options prefer Secrets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these resorts crowded?",
      "answer": "Secrets properties are larger (400-600 suites) and feel more active. Excellence properties (450-500 suites) better distribute guests across multiple areas. Neither feels cramped, but Excellence generally has better lounge and pool availability. Peak season (Christmas, Spring Break) challenges both."
