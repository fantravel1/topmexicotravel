  "introduction": "Iberostar Quetzal and its sister property Tucan put Iberostar on the Riviera Maya map back in 1998. What made them famous wasn't just Caribbean beach access—it was the wildlife. Peacocks strut across the paths. Coatis (raccoon relatives) appear at breakfast. Iguanas bask everywhere. The Mayan-inspired architecture has aged beautifully amid mature jungle landscaping. These aren't the flashiest or newest Iberostar properties, but they've developed character that new resorts can't manufacture.",

      "content": "**Animals on Property:**\n\nThis is what makes Quetzal/Tucan special. The properties were built to coexist with local wildlife, and animals roam freely.\n\n**What You'll See:**\n\n**Peacocks**\nThey're everywhere—strutting paths, displaying feathers, becoming part of the resort identity. Kids love them.\n\n**Coatis (Coatimundis)**\nRaccoon-like mammals that appear hoping for scraps. Cute but don't feed them (seriously, they can bite).\n\n**Iguanas**\nBask on rocks, paths, and near pools. Harmless and photogenic.\n\n**Tropical Birds**\nParrots, toucans (the resort's namesake), and various exotic species in the jungle canopy.\n\n**Wildlife Guidelines:**\n- Don't feed animals (posted everywhere)\n- Respect their space\n- Photos encouraged\n- Some areas have more activity\n- Morning and evening best for sightings\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nThe wildlife creates an experience unavailable at newer, more developed resorts. Children especially love the animal encounters that happen just walking to breakfast."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I really see peacocks and wildlife just walking around?",
      "answer": "Yes—the wildlife is real and present daily. Peacocks are everywhere, coatis appear at meals, iguanas bask on paths, and birds fill the canopy. It's not a zoo; they roam freely. Many guests consider this the resort's best feature."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I book Quetzal or Tucan?",
      "answer": "Either works—the differences are minimal. You access both properties regardless of where you book. Choose based on price or availability. Tucan is marginally quieter; Quetzal marginally more central. Don't overthink it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Quetzal/Tucan too old and dated?",
      "answer": "They're established, not dated. Some areas show age, but the mature landscaping and wildlife integration create character that new resorts can't match. If you need ultra-modern facilities, try Iberostar Paraíso. If you appreciate natural atmosphere, these deliver."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do these compare to the bigger Iberostar Paraíso complex?",
      "answer": "Paraíso is newer, larger, with more amenities (waterpark, golf). Quetzal/Tucan are older, smaller, with more natural character and wildlife. Paraíso feels like a mega-resort; Quetzal/Tucan feel like tropical hotels. Different appeals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the wildlife safe around children?",
      "answer": "Generally yes, with supervision. Don't let children feed or chase animals. Coatis can bite if people feed them (don't). Peacocks and iguanas are harmless. The wildlife is a highlight for most families—kids love it."
