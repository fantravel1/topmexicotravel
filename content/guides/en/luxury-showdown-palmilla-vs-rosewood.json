  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which is better for a honeymoon—Palmilla or Rosewood?",
      "answer": "Rosewood Mayakoba edges ahead for honeymoons due to private plunge pools in every suite (at Palmilla, you need villa-level for a private pool). The lagoon setting, boat transportation, and intimate scale create more romance per dollar. However, Palmilla's dramatic sunsets and desert glamour appeal to couples seeking Hollywood-style luxury."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is one resort better for families?",
      "answer": "Rosewood handles families better with larger standard suites and villa options designed for multiple generations. Palmilla works for families but is more adult-oriented in atmosphere. Both have excellent kids programs, but Rosewood's layout gives families more space without requiring top-tier villas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the beaches compare?",
      "answer": "Palmilla's beach is a protected cove—excellent for swimming, consistently calm, and dramatically scenic with cliff backdrops. Rosewood's Caribbean beach is longer and wider but occasionally affected by seaweed (April-August especially). For reliable swimming, Palmilla wins; for beach walks and Caribbean beauty, Rosewood."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit both during one trip to Mexico?",
      "answer": "Yes, though it requires domestic flight (Cancún to Los Cabos, ~3 hours). Some guests do 4 nights at each, experiencing both coasts. It's an extraordinary way to see Mexico's diversity, but the travel day is a consideration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better dining?",
      "answer": "Both are exceptional. Palmilla has the Jean-Georges pedigree at SEARED, which is a legitimate destination restaurant. Rosewood's restaurants integrate more with the natural setting—arriving by boat to Casa del Lago is unforgettable. Neither disappoints; your preference depends on whether you value chef prestige or atmospheric dining."
