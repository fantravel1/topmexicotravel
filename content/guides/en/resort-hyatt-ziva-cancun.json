  "introduction": "Hyatt Ziva Cancún combines two things families love: reliable Hyatt quality and World of Hyatt points earning/redemption. Located at the tip of the Hotel Zone with views of both lagoon and ocean, the resort offers one of Cancún's best locations plus a dolphin habitat on property. For Hyatt loyalists, it's one of the few luxury all-inclusives where points actually work well. For everyone else, it's simply a well-run family resort in a premium location.",

    {
      "question": "Is Hyatt Ziva worth the points redemption?",
      "answer": "Depends on your points situation. At 30,000+ points/night, it's a decent value during expensive periods but not exceptional. If you have Chase UR earning cards and want an all-inclusive, it's one of the best options. Cash rates are often reasonable, so compare before redeeming."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Ziva compare to Zilara?",
      "answer": "Same property, different sections. Zilara is adults-only with own pool, beach, and restaurants. Ziva is family-friendly. They share some facilities. Couples staying Zilara get away from children while still accessing Ziva restaurants. Families must stay Ziva."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the dolphin experience worth the extra cost?",
      "answer": "For kids who love marine life, typically yes—the convenience of on-site access is valuable. It's expensive ($140-350 depending on program) and some travelers have ethical concerns about captive dolphins. Make your own decision, but kids who do it usually love it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the food at Hyatt Ziva?",
      "answer": "Solid but not exceptional. It's reliable Hyatt quality—nothing embarrassing, nothing memorable. Moongate is the best option for adults. Family-friendly restaurants do their job. Don't expect Grand Velas quality, but it's better than budget all-inclusives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Hotel Zone location good for families?",
      "answer": "Mixed. Being able to walk to restaurants, shops, and activities is convenient. But you're also near nightclubs and party atmosphere. The resort itself is family-friendly; the surrounding area is Cancún's party central. Most families are fine, but it's not isolated resort peace."
