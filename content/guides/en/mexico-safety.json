      "title": "The Big Picture",
      "content": "Mexico is a massive country with 130 million people. Some areas face serious security challenges, while others are as safe as popular European destinations. Tourism zones—where visitors spend 99% of their time—have strong security presence and very low crime rates against tourists.\n\nThe key is knowing where to go (and where to avoid), using common sense, and following the same precautions you'd take in any major city worldwide."

      "title": "Safest Regions for Tourists",
      "content": "**Yucatán Peninsula (Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Mérida):** Extremely safe. The Yucatán state has some of Mexico's lowest crime rates, and Quintana Roo's tourism zone is heavily policed.\n\n**Oaxaca:** Very safe. The state capital and coast (Puerto Escondido, Huatulco) are peaceful with a strong community feel.\n\n**San Miguel de Allende & Guanajuato City:** Consistently rated Mexico's safest cities with large expat communities and almost no crime against tourists.\n\n**Mexico City (Tourist Areas):** Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Coyoacán, and Centro Histórico are well-policed and safe during daytime and evening. Use normal big-city precautions.\n\n**Los Cabos & Baja California Sur:** Safe tourism zone with resort-level security, though some areas of Baja California (the northern state) require caution.\n\n**Puerto Vallarta & Riviera Nayarit:** Very safe with strong tourism infrastructure and low crime against visitors."

      "title": "Areas Requiring Caution",
      "content": "The US State Department issues travel advisories by state. As of 2025, these states have 'Do Not Travel' or 'Reconsider Travel' advisories:\n\n- Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Michoacán (most areas), Guerrero (outside Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo), Colima, Zacatecas, Durango, parts of Chihuahua and Sonora\n\n**Important:** Advisories are often for specific areas, not entire states. Always check current advisories and drill down to specific regions. Many areas are perfectly safe while nearby zones may have issues."

    {
      "title": "Common Crimes Against Tourists",
      "content": "Most crimes against tourists are crimes of opportunity, not violence:\n\n**Pickpocketing:** Common in crowded areas (metros, markets, tourist sites). Use anti-theft bags, don't flash valuables.\n\n**ATM/Card Skimming:** Use ATMs inside banks during business hours. Cover PIN entry. Notify your bank of travel plans.\n\n**Taxi Scams:** Use Uber, official airport taxis (prepaid), or hotel-arranged transport. Never hail random taxis, especially at night.\n\n**Overcharging:** Always agree on prices before services (especially taxis, tours, and restaurants without menus). Check bills for errors.\n\n**Rental Car Issues:** Document existing damage thoroughly. Check for adequate insurance. Some agencies attempt to charge for pre-existing damage."

    {
      "title": "Practical Safety Tips",
      "content": "1. **Don't flash wealth:** Leave expensive jewelry at home. Carry small amounts of cash. Be discreet with phones and cameras.\n\n2. **Use Uber/DiDi:** These are safer than street taxis and provide a record of your trip. In areas without rideshare, use official taxi stands (sitio taxis).\n\n3. **Stay aware at night:** Stick to well-lit, busy areas. Avoid walking alone after midnight, especially after drinking.\n\n4. **Avoid political demonstrations:** While usually peaceful, they can turn unpredictable. Keep distance if you encounter one.\n\n5. **Know your limits with alcohol:** Drink spiking happens (rarely). Never accept drinks from strangers. Stay with your group.\n\n6. **Keep copies of documents:** Photograph your passport, FMM, and important documents. Store in cloud or email to yourself.\n\n7. **Use hotel safes:** Lock passports and valuables when out. Carry copies instead of originals when possible.\n\n8. **Trust your instincts:** If something feels wrong, leave. Your safety is more important than being polite."

      "title": "Road Safety",
      "content": "If renting a car:\n\n- **Avoid night driving:** Roads may lack lighting, animals cross, and in some areas, security deteriorates after dark.\n\n- **Use toll roads (cuotas):** They're safer, better maintained, and patrolled. Worth the cost.\n\n- **Don't resist at checkpoints:** Military and police checkpoints are common and legitimate. Be polite, show documents, and you'll be on your way.\n\n- **Get full insurance:** Mexican liability laws differ from the US/Canada. Get comprehensive coverage through your rental company or a Mexico-specific policy."

      "title": "What to Do If Something Happens",
      "content": "If you're a victim of crime:\n\n1. **Don't resist:** Especially in robberies. No possession is worth injury.\n\n2. **Report to police:** Visit the nearest police station or tourist police office. Request a copy of the report for insurance.\n\n3. **Contact your embassy:** For serious crimes, passport theft, or if you need assistance.\n\n4. **Call your travel insurance:** Most have 24/7 lines for emergencies.\n\n5. **Report card theft:** Call your bank immediately to freeze cards.\n\n6. **Document everything:** Take photos, save receipts, note names and badge numbers for insurance claims."

      "title": "Female Traveler Safety",
      "content": "Mexico is generally safe for female travelers, including solo women. Millions of women visit annually without incident. That said:\n\n- Catcalling (piropos) is unfortunately common but rarely escalates beyond words\n- Dress standards are relaxed in beach areas, more conservative in traditional regions\n- Trust your instincts about situations and people\n- Connect with other female travelers through apps and hostels\n- Avoid walking alone late at night, especially after drinking\n- Uber provides safety features including trip sharing"

      "title": "LGBTQ+ Traveler Safety",
      "content": "Mexico has become increasingly LGBTQ+ friendly, especially in:\n\n- **Mexico City:** Same-sex marriage legal since 2010. Zona Rosa is the main LGBTQ+ neighborhood.\n- **Puerto Vallarta:** One of Latin America's top LGBTQ+ destinations with dedicated hotels, bars, and beaches.\n- **Guadalajara:** Large LGBTQ+ scene and annual pride events.\n\nSmaller towns and rural areas may be more conservative. Public displays of affection could draw attention. As everywhere, use judgment about local attitudes."

    {
      "question": "Is Cancún safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. The Cancún Hotel Zone and tourist areas are very safe with heavy security presence. Use normal precautions (don't leave valuables on the beach, use rideshares at night) and stick to tourist zones. Violence that occasionally makes headlines typically involves organized crime, not tourists, and occurs away from tourist areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mexico City safe?",
      "answer": "Tourist neighborhoods (Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Centro Histórico, Coyoacán) are safe during the day and evening. Use Uber instead of street taxis, be aware of pickpockets in crowded areas, and avoid isolated areas late at night. It's a massive city—same precautions as any major metropolis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I drink the water?",
      "answer": "No. Stick to bottled water, which is widely available and cheap. Ice in restaurants is usually made from purified water and is safe. Brush teeth with bottled water to be extra cautious. Most stomach issues come from food rather than water—choose busy restaurants with high turnover."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I avoid getting sick?",
      "answer": "Eat at busy restaurants (high turnover means fresh food), avoid street food that's been sitting out, wash hands frequently, and ease into spicy food. Many travelers experience mild digestive adjustment—this is normal and usually passes in 1-2 days."
