Since 1956, this 250-acre estate on the southern tip of Baja California has hosted everyone from John Wayne to George Clooney to tech billionaires seeking anonymity. The $3,000-12,000+ nightly rates ensure a certain clientele, and the staff is legendary for treating celebrities exactly like everyone else: with impeccable service and complete discretion.",

      "content": "**How to Book:**\n\n**Best Approach:**\n1. Use a Virtuoso or Amex Fine Hotels travel advisor\n2. Advisor perks: upgrades, credits, amenities\n3. Book 4-6 months ahead for peak season\n4. Direct booking misses advisor benefits\n\n**Money-Saving Strategies:**\n- May-June offers 30-40% off peak rates\n- September-October similar discounts\n- Ask about 4th night free promotions\n- Book refundable and watch for sales\n\n**Upgrade Tips:**\n- Travel advisors have upgrade allocation\n- Mention celebrations (anniversary, birthday)\n- Off-peak arrivals more likely to upgrade\n- One&Only loyalty program exists (ask)\n\n**What to Request:**\n- Ocean-facing suite (worth the premium)\n- High floor for views\n- Away from construction if any\n- Early check-in/late checkout\n- Restaurant reservations pre-arrival\n\n**Red Flags to Avoid:**\n- Booking through discount sites (service differs)\n- Peak week arrivals (Christmas, NYE) without advance planning\n- Assuming all-inclusive (it's not)"

    {
      "question": "Is One&Only Palmilla worth the price?",
      "answer": "If you can comfortably afford it, yes. The combination of swimmable beach (rare in Cabos), world-class golf, exceptional dining, and genuine privacy creates an experience few resorts can match. The value is in the intangibles: discretion, space, and a staff that makes everything effortless."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I see celebrities at One&Only Palmilla?",
      "answer": "Possibly, but you won't recognize them behaving like celebrities. The resort culture is discretion—famous guests dress casually, dine at normal hours, and blend in. Staff never acknowledges celebrity presence, and photography of other guests is discouraged."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Palmilla good for families with children?",
      "answer": "Excellent for families who can afford it. The KidsOnly club is well-run, the beach is actually swimmable (huge for families), and multiple room configurations work for families. The atmosphere is relaxed enough for children while maintaining sophistication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the food situation—do I need to budget extra?",
      "answer": "Budget significantly extra. This is not all-inclusive. Breakfast averages $50-75/person, lunch $60-100, dinner at Agua $200-300/person with wine. A couple should budget $500-800/day for food and drinks minimum."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Palmilla compare to other ultra-luxury Cabos resorts?",
      "answer": "Palmilla wins for beach (swimmable), golf (on property), and established reputation. Waldorf Astoria Pedregal offers more dramatic architecture and privacy. Montage has newer facilities. Four Seasons at Costa Palmas is more remote but newer. Palmilla's 70-year legacy is unmatched."
