  "introduction": "Ocean Maya Royale pulls off something rare: adults-only all-inclusive at budget prices.

It's not Excellence or Secrets, and it doesn't pretend to be. But for couples wanting adult atmosphere without adult pricing, this hidden gem near Puerto Morelos delivers honest value.",

    {
      "question": "How does Ocean Maya compare to Excellence or Secrets?",
      "answer": "Not comparable in quality—Excellence and Secrets are several tiers higher. But Ocean Maya is 50-70% cheaper. If you need adults-only atmosphere and can compromise on food, rooms, and service quality, Ocean Maya delivers the essentials at budget pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the swim-out suites actually good?",
      "answer": "They're basic but functional. The pool access is real—you step out and you're in water. The rooms themselves are dated and won't win design awards. But at $200/night for swim-out access, the value is there if expectations are calibrated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the food actually bad?",
      "answer": "Not bad—mediocre. Buffet breakfast is decent. Dinner buffet is inconsistent. À la carte restaurants are better. You won't get sick, but you won't remember meals fondly. Consider supplementing with Puerto Morelos restaurants."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Ocean Maya good for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Only if budget requires it. Honeymoons typically deserve better quality. If you can stretch to Secrets or Excellence, do so. If Ocean Maya is what budget allows, it's adults-only and peaceful—not embarrassing, just not special."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stay at Ocean Maya or a family resort at the same price?",
      "answer": "If adults-only atmosphere matters, Ocean Maya wins. Same-price family resorts might have better facilities but include children everywhere. Choose based on whether peaceful atmosphere or property quality matters more."
