  "introduction": "Zoëtry Paraiso de la Bonita is what happens when a wellness retreat and luxury all-inclusive have a baby. The intimate 90-suite property includes a complimentary 20-minute massage for every guest, a Thalasso spa using Caribbean seawater, and an atmosphere so tranquil you might forget you're at an all-inclusive. While other resorts pay lip service to wellness, Zoëtry built their entire concept around it. If you want yoga and relaxation without sacrificing luxury dining and included cocktails, this is your place.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Zoëtry actually wellness-focused or is it marketing?",
      "answer": "Actually wellness-focused. The Thalasso spa with seawater treatments is unique in Mexico, the 20-minute complimentary massage is real, and daily yoga/wellness programming is substantive. It's not a hardcore wellness retreat, but it's far more genuine than resorts that just add a yoga class."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be bored at a 90-suite resort?",
      "answer": "If you need constant activity, pools full of people, and nightly entertainment, yes. If you want quiet beaches, peaceful pools, genuine relaxation, and quality time with your partner, no. Know yourself before booking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Thalassotherapy and is it worth trying?",
      "answer": "Thalassotherapy uses heated seawater for therapeutic benefit—it's a French wellness tradition. The seawater pools, jets, and treatments genuinely feel different from freshwater experiences. Whether it's \"worth it\" depends on your openness to spa experiences, but the Thalasso circuit is unique and included."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Zoëtry good for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Excellent for honeymoons prioritizing intimacy over activity. Swim-out suites are romantic, the beach is uncrowded, and the spa circuit is perfect for couples. It's not ideal if you want party pools and constant entertainment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does 24-hour dining actually work?",
      "answer": "You can order full restaurant menus anytime—not just a limited late-night menu. Hungry at 2am? Order from Piaf's French menu. The kitchen is always staffed for complete service. It's part of Endless Privileges and genuinely useful for odd hunger timing."
