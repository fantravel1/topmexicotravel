    {
      "question": "What is the cheapest time to visit Mexico?",
      "answer": "May to June and September to October offer the best value—prices drop 20-40% from peak season, weather is still reasonable (expect afternoon rain), and crowds are much smaller. Avoid Semana Santa (Easter) and Christmas periods regardless of month."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth visiting Mexico during rainy season?",
      "answer": "Yes! Rain typically falls in afternoon/evening storms lasting 1-2 hours, leaving mornings clear for activities. Prices are lower, crowds smaller, and the landscape is lush and green. It's actually a great time for cultural sites and mountain regions."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I avoid Cancún?",
      "answer": "US Spring Break (March, especially the third week) brings massive crowds of partying students to Cancún. If you want a relaxed vacation, avoid this period or choose alternative destinations like Tulum, Puerto Vallarta, or Oaxaca."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best month for Day of the Dead?",
      "answer": "Celebrations run October 31 to November 2, with November 1-2 being the main days. Book accommodations in Oaxaca, Pátzcuaro, or Mixquic weeks or months in advance—it's an increasingly popular time to visit."
