  "introduction": "Le Blanc Spa Resort Los Cabos brought the brand's sophisticated formula to Mexico's Pacific coast—and it works beautifully. The desert-meets-ocean landscape, Sea of Cortez views, and dramatic infinity pools create an aesthetic completely different from Caribbean properties. Butler service comes standard, the Blanc Spa is exceptional, and the adults-only atmosphere skews sophisticated rather than party-focused. If Cancún's Le Blanc is the original, Los Cabos is the refined evolution.",

      "question": "Can you really not swim at the beach?",
      "answer": "Correct—the Sea of Cortez beach at Le Blanc (like most Cabos beaches) has dangerous currents and waves unsuitable for swimming. This is true of nearly all Tourist Corridor resorts. The pools are exceptional compensation, and water activities are arranged via boat trips."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Le Blanc Los Cabos compare to Le Blanc Cancún?",
      "answer": "Los Cabos is more refined and design-forward with a desert aesthetic. Cancún is the original with a swimmable beach. Choose Cabos for sophistication and Sea of Cortez sunsets; choose Cancún if swimmable beach is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the butler service actually useful?",
      "answer": "Very useful if you engage with it. Butlers handle reservations, arrangements, problems, and personalization. Some guests barely use them; others rely on them constantly. The more you share your preferences and requests, the more value you get."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Le Blanc worth it over Secrets or Excellence?",
      "answer": "If butler service, spa hydrotherapy, and refined atmosphere matter—yes. If you want more restaurants, swimmable beach, or lower prices—consider alternatives. Le Blanc is for guests who value service sophistication over activity variety."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the crowd like at Le Blanc Los Cabos?",
      "answer": "Professional couples, honeymoons, and travelers seeking quiet elegance. Average age skews late 30s-50s. It's not a party atmosphere—guests are here for spa, service, and sophistication. If you want social energy, look elsewhere."
