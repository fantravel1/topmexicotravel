    {
      "question": "How does Excellence Playa Mujeres compare to Grand Velas?",
      "answer": "Grand Velas has better restaurants (especially Cocina de Autor), a more impressive spa, and higher overall luxury. Excellence offers 80% of the experience at 70% of the price. For couples prioritizing value, Excellence wins. For foodies or those wanting the best, Grand Velas wins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Excellence Club upgrade worth the extra money?",
      "answer": "It depends on your drinking habits and preferences. If you'll drink premium tequila and whiskey, eat lobster frequently, and value the exclusive rooftop pool, yes. If you're happy with standard premium spirits and don't need exclusivity, save the $400/night."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Excellence have such loyal repeat guests?",
      "answer": "Consistent quality at fair pricing creates trust. Guests know exactly what they're getting: excellent (not exceptional) everything at a price that doesn't require a second mortgage. The no-reservations dining policy reduces stress. Many couples return annually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the beach at Playa Mujeres really better than Cancún?",
      "answer": "Generally yes—newer development, less crowded, and often less seaweed due to location and currents. It's not guaranteed seaweed-free, but Playa Mujeres beaches are typically cleaner than both Hotel Zone and Riviera Maya."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we book Excellence or Secrets for our honeymoon?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent choices at similar price points. Excellence has more restaurants and the EC rooftop pool. Secrets has more locations and Preferred Club perks. Coin flip honestly—both deliver romantic experiences. Excellence loyalists swear by it."
