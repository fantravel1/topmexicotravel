  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be certified to dive in cenotes?",
      "answer": "For cavern diving (staying within natural light zone), Open Water certification is sufficient with a specialized cenote guide—which is required. For full cave diving beyond the light zone, you need cave diving certification, a technical credential requiring significant training. Most visitors do cavern dives, which are spectacular and accessible to regular certified divers. Many cenotes also offer excellent snorkeling for non-divers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best diving in Mexico for beginners?",
      "answer": "Cozumel's shallower sites (Paradise Reef, Chankanaab) offer calm conditions, warm water, and abundant marine life—perfect for new divers. Puerto Morelos has protected reefs with gentle conditions. The Sea of Cortez offers Los Islotes sea lions as an unforgettable beginner experience. Getting certified in Mexico is excellent due to warm, clear water and competitive pricing. Avoid cenotes until you have more experience and comfort underwater."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is cenote diving dangerous?",
      "answer": "Cavern diving with a qualified guide in the light zone is quite safe for certified divers—you always see the exit, follow the guideline, and have open water above. Full cave diving beyond the light zone is technical diving with real risks requiring extensive training. The danger comes from exceeding training/limits. Dozens of cave diving deaths in Mexican cenotes have occurred, almost all involving untrained or poorly equipped divers. Stay within your certification and always use qualified cenote guides."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time to dive the Sea of Cortez?",
      "answer": "Summer and fall (June-November) offer warmest water (80°F+), best visibility, and peak marine life including mantas, whale sharks, and hammerheads at El Bajo. October-April brings whale sharks near La Paz. Sea lions are year-round but water is cooler in winter (may need thicker wetsuit). For Socorro Islands, the season is November-May due to sea conditions. Each season has highlights—there's no truly bad time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do cenote dives compare to regular diving?",
      "answer": "Completely different experiences! Cenote diving features crystal-clear freshwater (200+ foot visibility), dramatic stalactites and stalagmites, ethereal light beams, haloclines (where fresh and salt water meet creating visual distortion), and no current. It's like diving in another world. Regular reef diving has saltwater, marine life, coral, and currents. Many divers say cenotes are among their most memorable dives ever. Do both if possible—they complement each other perfectly."
