  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the most popular cruise port in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Cozumel by far—it receives more cruise ships than any other Mexican port (over 1,000 annually). It's popular for excellent snorkeling, beautiful beaches, easy access from ships, and a well-developed tourism infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I book excursions through the cruise line?",
      "answer": "For complex or far-away excursions (like Chichén Itzá from Progreso), yes—the ship guarantee is worth it. For beach days, snorkeling, and easy activities, independent booking saves 50%+ and often provides better experiences with smaller groups."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the ship leave without me?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. If you're on a ship-sponsored tour, they'll wait. If you're independent, you MUST be back before all-aboard time. Build in buffer, have the ship's emergency contact, and don't cut it close."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to explore Mexican ports independently?",
      "answer": "The tourist areas of all major cruise ports are safe. Use common sense: don't flash valuables, use official taxis, stay in populated areas. These ports depend on cruise tourism and are well-patrolled."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need pesos or can I use dollars?",
      "answer": "Dollars are accepted almost everywhere in cruise port areas, but you'll get better prices with pesos. ATMs give reasonable rates—withdraw pesos if planning significant spending. Small tips work in either currency."
