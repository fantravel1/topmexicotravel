  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "At what age is it worth bringing kids to an all-inclusive?",
      "answer": "Most families find 3-4 years old is the sweet spot—old enough for kids clubs but young enough to enjoy the pool for hours. Under 3, parents work harder (no kids club access), but properties like Azul Beach make it easier. Teens can be hit-or-miss; adventurous teens love Hotel Xcaret, while social ones prefer larger resorts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are kids clubs actually safe?",
      "answer": "Reputable resorts take safety seriously—licensed staff, sign-in/sign-out procedures, security protocols, and background-checked employees. Always verify hours and ratios. First-day visits to meet staff help everyone feel comfortable. Trust your instincts; move on if something feels off."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do all-inclusives work for picky eaters?",
      "answer": "Yes—variety is the advantage. Most buffets have familiar options (pasta, chicken tenders, pizza), and room service saves difficult dinner situations. Alert the restaurant and they'll often prepare off-menu items for kids. Pack a few favorite snacks as backup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we get time away from kids at family resorts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—that's the point. Kids clubs with evening hours (Finest Playa Mujeres until 10pm) allow romantic dinners. Most resorts offer babysitting services for additional fees. Adults-only pools and restaurants exist at many family properties specifically for parent escape time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is better—Cancún or Riviera Maya for families?",
      "answer": "Riviera Maya generally has calmer beaches and more nature activities (cenotes, ruins). Cancún offers Hotel Zone energy and easier access to entertainment. For young kids, Riviera Maya's gentle beaches win. For teens, Cancún's proximity to activities appeals. Both work well."
