  "introduction": "Cenotes are natural sinkholes filled with crystal-clear freshwater, formed when limestone bedrock collapses and reveals underground rivers. The Yucatán Peninsula has an estimated 6,000+ cenotes, and they were sacred to the ancient Maya—portals to the underworld. Today they offer some of the world's most unique swimming, snorkeling, and diving experiences.",

      "title": "What Are Cenotes?",
      "content": "**Geology:**\nCenotes formed over millions of years as rainwater dissolved the limestone bedrock of the Yucatán Peninsula. The result is an interconnected underground river system spanning hundreds of miles, with cenotes as natural access points to these subterranean waters.\n\n**Types of Cenotes:**\n\n1. **Open/Cave Cenotes (Abiertos):** Fully collapsed ceiling, open to the sky. Example: Cenote Azul\n\n2. **Semi-open Cenotes:** Partially collapsed ceiling with some cave overhang. Example: Ik Kil\n\n3. **Cave Cenotes (Cavernas):** Mostly underground with small opening. Example: Cenote Suytun\n\n4. **Underground Cenotes:** Fully enclosed, accessed through cave entrances. Example: Cenotes at Aktun Chen\n\n**Why They're Special:**\n- Visibility often exceeds 100 feet (30+ meters)\n- Constant temperature around 75-77°F (24-25°C) year-round\n- Unique ecosystems with endemic species\n- Haloclines create visual effects where fresh and salt water meet\n- Stalactites and stalagmites in cave cenotes\n- Sacred significance to Mayan culture"

      "title": "Cenote Snorkeling Tips",
      "content": "**What to Expect:**\nSnorkeling cenotes is magical. The water is so clear you'll feel like you're floating in air. Most cenotes have platforms, stairs, or ladders for easy access.\n\n**Best Cenotes for Snorkeling:**\n1. Gran Cenote - Turtles, caves you can swim into, platforms\n2. Casa Cenote - Fish in mangroves, possible manatees\n3. Cenote Cristal - Easy swimming, beautiful\n4. Cenote Azul - Multiple pools, fish\n5. Dos Ojos - If you want to see cave formations from surface\n\n**Gear:**\n- Bring your own mask and snorkel for best fit\n- Rentals available at most cenotes (~$50-100 MXN)\n- Life jackets required at some cenotes\n- Water shoes helpful for rocky entries\n\n**Tips:**\n- Shower before entering (removes sunscreen oils)\n- Don't touch formations or walls\n- Watch for depth changes—some areas are very deep\n- Stay calm near cave openings—disorientation possible\n- Morning visits have better light penetration\n\n**Non-Swimmers:**\nMany cenotes are fine for non-swimmers with life jackets. Float and enjoy—no swimming needed. Cenotes like Ik Kil and Suytun have shallow areas and platforms."

      "title": "Visiting Cenotes Responsibly",
      "content": "**Environmental Rules:**\n\n1. **Sunscreen:** Use ONLY reef-safe, biodegradable sunscreen or none at all. Chemicals damage ecosystems and cloud the water. Many cenotes ban regular sunscreen.\n\n2. **Shower First:** Rinse off oils, sweat, and sunscreen before entering. Showers provided.\n\n3. **No Touching:** Don't touch stalactites, stalagmites, or walls. Formations took thousands of years to form; oils from hands damage them.\n\n4. **No Littering:** Pack out everything. Cenotes connect to the ocean—pollution spreads.\n\n5. **No Feeding Fish:** Disrupts natural behavior and ecosystem.\n\n6. **Respect Wildlife:** Turtles, fish, and other creatures live here. Don't chase or touch them.\n\n**Cultural Respect:**\n- Cenotes were sacred to the Maya—treat them with reverence\n- Some cenotes are on community land—support local management\n- Ask permission before photographing locals or ceremonies\n- Pay fair prices—tourism supports communities\n\n**Sustainable Choices:**\n- Visit lesser-known cenotes to reduce pressure on popular ones\n- Book community-run cenotes (Homún, Cuzamá)\n- Hire local guides rather than big tour operators\n- Visit during off-peak hours"

    {
      "question": "Are cenotes safe to swim in?",
      "answer": "Yes, cenotes are generally safe for swimming. The water is clean freshwater, and most popular cenotes have proper safety measures including life jackets, platforms, and staff. However, be aware of depth (some areas are very deep), respect any posted rules, wear life jackets if you're not a strong swimmer, and never dive or enter caves without proper certification and guides. Some cenotes have hidden depth changes or currents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to know how to swim to visit cenotes?",
      "answer": "No, many cenotes are accessible to non-swimmers. Life jackets are available (often required) at most cenotes, allowing you to float comfortably. Cenotes like Ik Kil, Suytun, and many others have shallow areas, platforms, and stairs. You can enjoy the experience simply by floating or wading. Choose open cenotes with good facilities for the easiest experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is reef-safe sunscreen and where can I buy it?",
      "answer": "Reef-safe sunscreen is biodegradable and free of oxybenzone and octinoxate—chemicals that damage marine ecosystems. Look for brands with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as active ingredients. Available at Walmart, pharmacies, and eco-shops in Tulum and Playa del Carmen. Better yet, wear UV protective clothing and skip sunscreen entirely when visiting cenotes. Many cenotes will turn you away if you have visible sunscreen on."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time do I need at each cenote?",
      "answer": "Plan 1-2 hours per cenote for a relaxed experience. Quick swimmers might do 45 minutes. Photographers, divers, and those who want to soak it all in should allow 2+ hours. If visiting multiple cenotes in a day, 3-4 is a comfortable maximum before fatigue sets in. Remember that getting to and from cenotes takes time too."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I visit cenotes during rainy season?",
      "answer": "Yes, cenotes are a great rainy season activity since they're mostly sheltered. However, heavy rains can temporarily cloud the water with runoff. Cave cenotes are less affected than open ones. The advantage is far fewer tourists during rainy season (June-October). After a few dry days, water clarity usually returns. Rainy season afternoons often bring brief storms, so mornings are best."
