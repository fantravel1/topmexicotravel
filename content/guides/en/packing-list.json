    {
      "question": "Can I bring prescription medications to Mexico?",
      "answer": "Yes, bring medications in original labeled containers with a copy of your prescription. Common medications don't require documentation, but controlled substances (opioids, ADHD meds, etc.) should have written prescriptions. Bring only what you need for your trip length."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a voltage converter for Mexico?",
      "answer": "Mexico uses 127V/60Hz with Type A/B plugs (same as US/Canada). US travelers don't need converters. European/UK travelers need a plug adapter but most modern electronics (phones, laptops) handle 100-240V automatically. Check your charger's label."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pack formal clothes for Mexico?",
      "answer": "Mexico is generally casual. One nice outfit for upscale restaurants is enough. Beach towns are very casual (shorts and sandals everywhere). Cities like Mexico City and Guadalajara are slightly dressier but still relaxed by European standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I pack reef-safe sunscreen?",
      "answer": "Look for 'reef-safe' or 'ocean-friendly' labels. Avoid oxybenzone and octinoxate. Brands like Stream2Sea, Raw Elements, and Thinksport are reliable. Note: Many cenotes and eco-parks in Mexico require reef-safe sunscreen or provide their own."
