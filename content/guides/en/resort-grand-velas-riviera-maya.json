  "introduction": "Grand Velas Riviera Maya changed what people thought was possible at an all-inclusive resort. When it opened in 2008, the idea that unlimited food and drinks could mean Michelin-quality dining, premium spirits, and genuine luxury seemed impossible. Grand Velas proved otherwise. Today, it remains the benchmark—the resort other luxury all-inclusives measure themselves against. The eight restaurants include a French fine-dining experience (Piaf), a Mexican haute-cuisine destination (Frida), and a chef's-table tasting menu experience (Cocina de Autor) that rivals any standalone restaurant in Mexico.",

    {
      "question": "Is Grand Velas Riviera Maya really worth $1,400+/night?",
      "answer": "If you would normally spend $400-500/night on a luxury hotel plus $200-300/day on food and drinks, Grand Velas is comparable while offering significantly better dining. The eight restaurants, premium spirits, and included services provide genuine value at the price point. It's the only all-inclusive where the food alone justifies the rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Zen Grand, Ambassador, and Grand Class?",
      "answer": "Zen Grand is adults-only in a jungle setting—quieter and more contemplative. Ambassador is family-friendly near the beach with kids' facilities. Grand Class is the premium tier with butler service, exclusive pool/beach areas, and enhanced inclusions like spa credits. All share the eight restaurants."
    },
    {
      "question": "How hard is it to get restaurant reservations?",
      "answer": "Competitive, especially for Cocina de Autor and Piaf. Book immediately upon arrival or contact concierge before you arrive. Plan to dine at one specialty restaurant per night. Room service offers full menus if you can't get a reservation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Grand Velas good for families?",
      "answer": "Excellent. The Ambassador section is designed for families, with kids' club, teen activities, and family suites. Children eat free at certain times, and the kids' programming is extensive. Adults wanting quiet should choose Zen Grand or Grand Class."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the seaweed situation work at Grand Velas?",
      "answer": "Like all Riviera Maya beaches, seaweed (sargassum) can be an issue, typically March-August. Grand Velas has dedicated crews cleaning the beach, and the pools are always perfect. Check recent reviews for current conditions if beach is your priority."
