      "question": "Will I get sick from eating street food in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Most travelers eat street food without problems. Stick to busy stalls with high turnover, freshly cooked food, and visible cleanliness. Start slowly, stay hydrated, and your stomach will adjust. Bring Pepto-Bismol as backup, but don't let fear prevent you from experiencing Mexico's best food."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a taqueria and a restaurant?",
      "answer": "A taqueria specializes in tacos—usually a casual stand or small shop. Restaurants (restaurantes or fondas) serve full menus. Taquerias are often cheaper and more authentic. The best tacos usually come from humble stands, not fancy restaurants."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Mexican food very spicy?",
      "answer": "Not automatically. Salsas are served on the side, so you control the heat. Ask 'es picante?' (is it spicy?) before ordering. Green salsas can be hotter than red. Start small with salsas until you know your tolerance. Staff will warn you about especially hot items."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best food tour to take?",
      "answer": "Food tours are excellent for orientation. Top options: Eat Mexico or Club Tengo Hambre in Mexico City, Oaxaca Eats in Oaxaca, and Vallarta Food Tours in Puerto Vallarta. Book early—good tours sell out. After the tour, return to your favorite spots independently."
