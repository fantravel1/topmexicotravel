  "introduction": "It's the classic Riviera Maya dilemma: Cancun or Playa del Carmen? Both sit on the same stunning Caribbean coastline, both offer incredible beaches and all-inclusive resorts, and both provide easy access to cenotes and Mayan ruins. Yet they deliver fundamentally different vacation experiences. Cancun is the polished resort city with world-class infrastructure; Playa del Carmen is the walkable beach town with bohemian soul. This guide breaks down everything—beaches, nightlife, dining, hotels, and vibe—so you can choose with confidence.",

The Hotel Zone delivers exactly what it promises: beautiful beaches, mega-resorts, and world-class nightlife. You'll never feel lost or uncertain.\n\n**Playa del Carmen** rewards travelers who want more texture—the ability to walk to dinner, discover a hidden cenote, catch live music, and feel like you're in a real place rather than a resort bubble. It's the choice for return visitors, foodies, and those seeking the beach-town-romance combination.\n\n**Neither is objectively better**—they serve different vacation styles. The beauty of the Riviera Maya is that both are accessible in a single trip.\n\n**Our Recommendation:**\n- First trip to Mexico: Cancun\n- Second trip: Playa del Carmen or split stay\n- Honeymoon: Playa (boutique) or Cancun (luxury all-inclusive)\n- Family: Cancun\n- Group of friends: Depends on age (20s = Cancun, 30s+ = Playa)"

    {
      "question": "Is Playa del Carmen or Cancun better for families?",
      "answer": "Cancun is generally better for families due to its mega-resorts with extensive kids' programs, multiple pools, and all-inclusive convenience. Resorts like Hyatt Ziva, Moon Palace, and Dreams offer dedicated children's facilities. Playa can work for families but requires more planning—consider the Grand Hyatt or all-inclusive resorts south of town."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better beaches—Cancun or Playa del Carmen?",
      "answer": "Cancun has objectively better beaches—wider, with more consistent powder-white sand and fewer seaweed issues. The Hotel Zone beaches, particularly on the north-facing section, are among Mexico's best. Playa's beaches are good but narrower, more crowded downtown, and can be hit harder by sargassum."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you walk around Cancun like Playa del Carmen?",
      "answer": "Not really. Cancun's Hotel Zone is a 14-mile strip designed for resort stays and driving. While you can walk between nearby resorts, there's no pedestrian-friendly town center like Playa's 5th Avenue. Downtown Cancun has walkable areas but it's 20 minutes from the Hotel Zone and not a tourist destination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is cheaper—Cancun or Playa del Carmen?",
      "answer": "Playa del Carmen is typically 20-30% cheaper for independent travelers—hotels, restaurants, and activities cost less. However, Cancun all-inclusive packages can offer better value for families since everything's included. Budget travelers can find cheap accommodation in both, but Playa has more mid-range options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth staying in both Cancun and Playa del Carmen?",
      "answer": "If you have 7+ days, absolutely. A split stay gives you the best of both: Cancun's resort experience and beaches plus Playa's walkable charm and dining scene. They're only an hour apart by bus or car. Consider 4 nights Cancun, 3 nights Playa for an ideal combination."
