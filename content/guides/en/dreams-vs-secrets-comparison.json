    {
      "question": "Can children stay at Secrets resorts?",
      "answer": "No. Secrets resorts are strictly adults-only (18+). This is a core brand promise and is not negotiable. If you're traveling with anyone under 18, Dreams, Now, or Sunscape are the AMResorts family-friendly options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the food better at Secrets than Dreams?",
      "answer": "Food quality is comparable—both brands use similar suppliers and recipes. The difference is atmosphere: Secrets restaurants are quieter, more romantic, and slightly more refined in presentation. You'll eat well at both; the experience just differs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dreams guests visit Secrets restaurants?",
      "answer": "At some locations where both brands operate nearby (like Riviera Cancún), the Sip, Savor & See program allows guests to dine at sister properties. Check with your resort for specific exchange privileges—usually one dinner visit is included."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dreams good for couples without kids?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially budget-conscious couples. Dreams offers adults-only quiet pools for escape from families, and you'll save 30-40% compared to Secrets. Just know that children will be present at meals, main pools, and beaches. If that's fine, Dreams delivers excellent value for couples."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which brand has better rooms?",
      "answer": "Secrets rooms are larger on average and all are classified as suites. Dreams rooms are good quality but slightly smaller at entry level. For the best room experience regardless of brand, upgrade to Preferred Club—the benefits are similar at both but Secrets PC edges ahead on service touches."
