  "introduction": "Value isn't about cheap—it's about getting more than you expected for what you paid.

We've analyzed dozens of Mexican all-inclusives to identify where your money works hardest at every price tier.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is a more expensive all-inclusive actually worth it?",
      "answer": "Often yes—the jump from $300 to $600/night typically brings significant improvements in food, drinks, and service. The jump from $600 to $1,200 brings luxury touches. Above $1,500, you're paying for exclusivity and perfection rather than fundamental improvements. The sweet spot for most travelers is $600-900/night."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the biggest value difference between tiers?",
      "answer": "Food and drinks. Budget all-inclusives serve acceptable but uninspiring food with well-brand spirits. Premium all-inclusives offer restaurant-quality dining and top-shelf drinks. This single factor often justifies the price jump for food-focused travelers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are travel agent rates actually better?",
      "answer": "Sometimes significantly so. Agents access unpublished rates, especially for luxury properties. They also get added perks (upgrades, credits) that offset their commission. For properties over $800/night, consulting a Virtuoso or AMEX Travel agent often pays off."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if an all-inclusive is really all-inclusive?",
      "answer": "Check: Are all restaurants included or just some? Are premium spirits extra? Is WiFi included? Is 24-hour room service available? Properties like Dreams/Secrets (Unlimited-Luxury) and Excellence include everything; some competitors nickel-and-dime with upcharges."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time to find value at luxury resorts?",
      "answer": "September-October offers 30-50% discounts at top properties. You can stay at Excellence Playa Mujeres for what Dreams costs during peak season. Weather risk exists, but the value is exceptional for flexible travelers."
