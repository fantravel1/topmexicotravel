Check \"multi-city\" fares; they're often barely more than round-trips."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Cancún airport safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cancún airport is very safe and tourist-friendly. The main annoyance is aggressive timeshare sales in the arrival hall—walk past them confidently. Use authorized transportation (ADO bus, official taxi booths, pre-booked transfers) and you'll have no issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I fly into Cancún and visit Mexico City?",
      "answer": "You can, but it's inefficient. Cancún to Mexico City is a 2.5-hour flight or 20+ hour bus. If Mexico City is on your itinerary, fly there directly or use an open-jaw ticket. The only exception: if Cancún is significantly cheaper and you're doing a long trip anyway."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which airport has better food and amenities?",
      "answer": "Mexico City (MEX) has more dining options and lounges due to its size. Cancún has adequate food courts and some lounges, but it's designed for quick transfers to resorts, not extended stays. Neither is a destination airport—get to your hotel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about altitude at Mexico City airport?",
      "answer": "Mexico City is at 7,350 feet elevation. Most people feel fine, but some experience mild symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue) the first day. Take it easy, stay hydrated, limit alcohol initially. If you're going directly to a beach destination, you won't notice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about flying into other Mexican airports?",
      "answer": "Direct flights to your destination are often best: Puerto Vallarta (PVR), Los Cabos (SJD), Guadalajara (GDL), Oaxaca (OAX), and Mérida (MID) all have international service. Check direct flight availability before defaulting to CUN or MEX connections."
