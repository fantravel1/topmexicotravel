    {
      "question": "Which is better for swimming—Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos?",
      "answer": "Puerto Vallarta has significantly more swimmable beaches. Banderas Bay creates calmer conditions, and most beaches are safe for swimming. In Los Cabos, many beaches have dangerous currents and are not swimmable—look for green flag beaches like Médano, Chileno, and Santa María."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos better for couples?",
      "answer": "Both work beautifully for couples but deliver different vibes. Puerto Vallarta offers romantic walks on the Malecón, candlelit dinners in Zona Romántica, and a more intimate town feel. Los Cabos delivers glamour, dramatic sunsets at El Arco, and ultra-luxury resorts. Choose PV for charm, Cabos for glitz."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is cheaper—Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos?",
      "answer": "Puerto Vallarta is significantly cheaper—typically 40-60% less expensive across hotels, restaurants, and activities. A comfortable mid-range vacation in PV might cost $200-300/day; the same level in Cabos runs $400-600/day. Los Cabos positions itself as a luxury destination with pricing to match."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you do both Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in one trip?",
      "answer": "They're not close together—Puerto Vallarta is mainland Mexico while Los Cabos is at the southern tip of Baja California. Flying between them takes about 2 hours and isn't cheap. For most travelers, pick one destination per trip. If you have 2+ weeks and budget allows, you could do both with a flight connection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better whale watching?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent December through March when humpback whales visit. Los Cabos sees gray whales in the calmer Sea of Cortez waters, making it slightly easier to spot them. Puerto Vallarta's humpbacks are dramatic but in choppier Pacific waters. Both deliver memorable whale watching—it's essentially a tie."
