      "title": "Long-Distance Buses",
      "content": "**Mexico's Secret Weapon:** First-class Mexican buses are genuinely excellent—often better than flying for medium distances. Reclining seats, WiFi, movies, bathrooms, and no airport hassle.\n\n**Bus Classes:**\n- **Primera Plus/ETN (Ejecutivo):** The best. Fully reclining seats (like business class), 2+1 configuration, snacks, individual screens. Worth the premium.\n- **ADO GL/Platino:** Similar luxury for routes in southern Mexico.\n- **Primera (First Class):** Comfortable, 2+2 seating, AC, bathroom. The standard for tourist routes.\n- **Segunda (Second Class):** Local buses, frequent stops, budget option. Fine for short trips.\n\n**Major Bus Companies:**\n- **ADO:** Dominates southern Mexico (Yucatán, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz). Excellent.\n- **ETN/Primera Plus:** Central and western Mexico (CDMX, Guadalajara, Guanajuato). Top quality.\n- **Estrella Blanca:** Northern routes.\n- **Pullman de Morelos:** Cuernavaca, Taxco routes.\n\n**Booking:**\n- Book online at ADO.com.mx, PrimeraPlus.com.mx, or ETN.com.mx\n- Or buy at bus stations (TAPO, Norte, Sur in Mexico City)\n- Reserve 1-2 days ahead for popular routes, same-day usually fine otherwise\n\n**Sample Bus Times & Prices:**\n- Mexico City to Oaxaca: 6-7 hours, $30-50 USD (first class)\n- Cancún to Mérida: 4-5 hours, $20-35 USD\n- Mexico City to Guanajuato: 5 hours, $35-55 USD\n- Guadalajara to Puerto Vallarta: 5 hours, $25-40 USD"

      "content": "**When to Rent:**\n- Road trips (Baja California, Yucatán Peninsula, Pacific Coast)\n- Exploring ruins and cenotes independently\n- Visiting multiple small towns\n- When buses don't go where you want\n\n**When NOT to Rent:**\n- Mexico City (traffic, parking nightmare, Uber is better)\n- Beach resort stays (taxi/shuttle cheaper than parking + insurance)\n- If you're uncomfortable with aggressive driving styles\n\n**Rental Tips:**\n- **Book in advance** from home through major companies (Hertz, Avis, Budget, National)\n- **Get full insurance:** Mexican liability laws are different. Get the CDW (collision damage waiver) and liability coverage. Your US insurance and credit cards usually DON'T cover Mexico.\n- **Inspect thoroughly:** Document every scratch with photos before leaving the lot\n- **Use toll roads (cuotas):** They're safer, faster, and well-maintained. Worth the cost.\n- **Don't drive at night:** Poorly lit roads, animals, potholes, and in some areas, security concerns.\n- **Carry cash for tolls:** Most toll booths don't take cards\n\n**Costs:**\n- Economy car: $25-45 USD/day\n- Full insurance: Add $15-30 USD/day\n- Gas: Similar to US prices (~$1/liter)\n- Tolls: $5-40 USD depending on route\n\n**Gas Stations:** Pemex is the main chain (recently joined by others). Full service—attendants pump gas. Tip 10-20 pesos."

    {
      "question": "Is it safe to drive in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Daylight driving on main highways and toll roads is generally safe. Avoid driving at night (poor lighting, animals, and in some areas security concerns). Toll roads (cuotas) are much safer than free roads (libres). Get full insurance. Some areas have travel advisories—check current state department guidance for your route."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I rent a car or use buses?",
      "answer": "Depends on your trip. Rent a car for: Baja road trips, cenote hopping in Yucatán, exploring small towns, or when you want flexibility. Use buses for: City-to-city travel on main routes, when you want to relax, or in Mexico City where driving is stressful. Many travelers combine both."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get from Cancún airport to Tulum?",
      "answer": "Options from cheapest to most convenient: 1) ADO bus ($15-20, 2+ hours, drops at Tulum town—not beach), 2) Shared shuttle ($25-35, multiple stops), 3) Private transfer ($80-120, direct to hotel). For the beach zone hotels, private transfer is usually worth it as public transit doesn't go there."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Uber safe in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Yes, Uber is considered safer than street taxis in Mexico. You have a record of the trip, driver info, and digital payment. It's widely used by locals and tourists. The main limitations are coverage (not available everywhere) and some areas like Cancún Hotel Zone where taxis have blocked Uber."
