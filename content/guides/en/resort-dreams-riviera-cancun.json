  "introduction": "Dreams Riviera Cancún occupies the sweet spot families are looking for: quality high enough to feel like a real vacation for adults, with programming substantial enough to keep kids genuinely entertained. The Unlimited-Luxury concept means everything is included—no nickeling and diming for ice cream cones or kids' activities. Parents can enjoy quality restaurants and premium drinks while kids are occupied at Explorer's Club. It's not ultra-luxury, but it's genuinely good.",

    {
      "question": "Is Dreams Riviera Cancún too chaotic with kids everywhere?",
      "answer": "No—it's well-managed. Families are present but it doesn't feel like a daycare. Adults-only areas exist (Preferred Club pool, Bordeaux restaurant evenings), and the property is large enough to find quiet spots. It's family-friendly, not family-dominated."
    },
    {
      "question": "How good is the Explorer's Club really?",
      "answer": "Genuinely good—one of the better kids' programs in the region. Activities are engaging, staff is trained, and kids typically enjoy it. The evening program is particularly valuable, allowing parents real date nights. Kids often don't want to leave."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we do Dreams with a toddler (under 3)?",
      "answer": "Yes, but Explorer's Club is ages 3-12. Under 3 requires babysitting services (extra cost) or one parent always with child. Many families with toddlers stay here successfully—you just won't get the free childcare benefit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the food actually good or just 'all-inclusive good'?",
      "answer": "It's solid all-inclusive food—better than budget options, not as good as Grand Velas. Bordeaux and Himitsu are the standouts. Don't expect fine dining, but expect satisfying meals. Kids will find plenty they like."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we do Preferred Club with kids?",
      "answer": "Mixed recommendation. Kids often prefer the main pool (more children to play with), which reduces PC pool value. PC lounge is useful for snacks, and suite upgrades help with space. Calculate: $150/night × nights = PC cost. Worth it for longer stays with older kids."
