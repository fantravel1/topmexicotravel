  "introduction": "RIU Cancún was among the first all-inclusives in the Hotel Zone, and the Spanish chain has kept it relevant through ongoing renovations. It's not the newest or fanciest RIU property—RIU Palace Costa Mujeres claims those titles—but it delivers the reliable RIU formula at a lower price point. The beachfront location is excellent, rooms have been updated, and you know exactly what you're getting: solid all-inclusive basics from a brand that's been doing this for decades.",

    {
      "question": "How is RIU Cancún different from RIU Palace?",
      "answer": "RIU Palace properties are their premium tier—better food, upgraded rooms, more services. RIU Cancún is classic budget tier. Same brand reliability, different service level. Palace Costa Mujeres is the local upgrade option if budget allows."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the deal with the in-room liquor dispenser?",
      "answer": "Classic RIU feature—your room has a dispenser with whiskey, rum, vodka, and sometimes gin. Quality is basic (well brands). It's convenient for in-room drinks without calling room service. A unique RIU touch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is RIU Cancún too old and dated?",
      "answer": "Recent renovations have updated rooms significantly. Some common areas show age, but guest rooms are refreshed. It's not new construction, but it's well-maintained. Don't expect modern boutique design—expect updated classic resort."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the beach compare to other Hotel Zone properties?",
      "answer": "Same Caribbean Sea, similar sand quality. RIU's position at Km 5.5 is actually quite good for swimming conditions. Beach management may be less aggressive than luxury properties, so seaweed can be more present during affected seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is RIU Cancún good for families?",
      "answer": "Solid choice for budget-minded families. RiuLand kids' club is included and decent. Pools work for kids. Food variety is good enough. It's not Dreams or Hyatt Ziva level, but it's good value for families watching spending."
