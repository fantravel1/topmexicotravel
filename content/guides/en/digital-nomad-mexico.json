    {
      "question": "Can I legally work remotely in Mexico on a tourist visa?",
      "answer": "This is a gray area. Technically, the tourist permit doesn't authorize 'work,' but remote work for non-Mexican companies is widely practiced and tolerated. You're not taking jobs from Mexicans or using Mexican services. Don't mention 'work' at immigration—say you're visiting/traveling. For stays over 180 days or working with Mexican companies, get a proper temporary resident visa."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best city in Mexico for digital nomads?",
      "answer": "Mexico City offers the best overall package: fastest internet, most coworking options, incredible food and culture, and a huge nomad community. Playa del Carmen is best for beach + work balance. Oaxaca offers the best value and culture for lower cost. Mérida is safest and most affordable. Your choice depends on priorities—beach vs. city, budget vs. amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money do I need to live in Mexico as a digital nomad?",
      "answer": "$1,500/month is comfortable in most cities outside beach resort areas. $2,000-2,500 gives you a nice apartment, regular restaurants, coworking membership, and activities. Mexico City and Playa del Carmen are pricier than Oaxaca or Mérida. Budget nomads can manage on $1,000-1,200 with shared housing and cooking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the internet good enough for video calls in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Yes, in major cities and nomad hubs. Fiber internet (50-300+ Mbps) is common in CDMX, Guadalajara, and growing in other cities. Always ask about internet when booking accommodation, test the connection, and have a phone hotspot backup. Coworking spaces have reliable, fast connections. Rural areas and some beach towns may have slower speeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I extend my stay beyond 180 days?",
      "answer": "Options: 1) Do a 'visa run'—leave Mexico (to Guatemala, Belize, or US) and return for a new 180 days (not guaranteed but common). 2) Apply for temporary resident visa at a Mexican consulate in your home country—requires proof of income (~$2,500/month) or savings. The temporary resident route is more reliable for long-term stays and offers benefits like bank accounts."
