  "introduction": "Iberostar Paraíso Maya is part of a massive 5-hotel complex sharing 700+ acres of Riviera Maya coastline. The Spanish chain has figured out how to make mega-resort scale feel manageable: each property maintains its identity while guests access the entire complex's facilities. With golf, waterpark, multiple pools, and dozens of restaurants across the development, the only limit is how much exploring you want to do.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is the complex too big and overwhelming?",
      "answer": "It can be if you try to see everything. Best approach: pick a home base (your property's pool, a favorite restaurant), establish routine, then explore gradually. Some guests love the variety; others feel exhausted. Know yourself before booking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I really eat at any restaurant in the complex?",
      "answer": "Yes—all 20+ restaurants are included regardless of which property you're staying at. Some require reservations. You're not limited to your specific hotel, which is the main advantage of the complex approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pay more for beachfront properties?",
      "answer": "If beach proximity matters, yes. Paraíso Maya is set back—you'll shuttle or walk to beach. Paraíso Beach and del Mar are directly on the sand. The premium is usually $50-100/night and worth it for beach lovers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the golf course?",
      "answer": "Solid resort course with interesting jungle and cenote features. Not championship caliber, but enjoyable for most golfers. The convenience of walking to the first tee is valuable. Green fees are extra but discounted for guests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Iberostar good for multi-generational trips?",
      "answer": "Excellent—the multiple properties allow different generations to stay where they're most comfortable (Grand for adults, Maya for families), while still being able to meet for dinner. The variety keeps everyone happy."
