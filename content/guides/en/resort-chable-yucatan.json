  "introduction": "Chablé Yucatán isn't a beach resort—it's a journey into the soul of Mexico. Built around a restored 19th-century hacienda and a sacred cenote believed by the Maya to be a portal to the underworld, Chablé offers something no coastal property can: genuine cultural and spiritual depth. Here, Mayan shamans lead temazcal ceremonies, chefs forage from surrounding jungle, and the cenote at the property's heart provides both literal and metaphorical depth. This is where billionaires come to find meaning, not just beaches.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Chablé Yucatán worth it without a beach?",
      "answer": "If you're open to what Chablé offers, absolutely. The cenote provides swimming, the spa is world-class, and the cultural depth is unmatched. It's a different type of vacation—restorative, meaningful, transformative. If beach time is essential, combine Chablé with a coastal stay afterward."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a temazcal ceremony like?",
      "answer": "A temazcal is a Mayan sweat lodge—a dome-shaped structure heated by volcanic stones. A shaman leads the ceremony with chanting, prayers, and copal incense. It's physically intense (hot and dark) and spiritually significant. You emerge feeling cleansed. Not recommended for claustrophobic guests or those with heart conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be spiritual to enjoy Chablé?",
      "answer": "Not at all. While Chablé offers deep spiritual experiences, guests can simply enjoy the stunning property, cenote swimming, excellent food, and spa treatments without any spiritual participation. The programming is available, not mandatory."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Chablé Yucatán compare to Chablé Maroma?",
      "answer": "Chablé Maroma is their beachfront property near Playa del Carmen—same ownership, similar quality, but with Caribbean beach access. Many guests combine both: spiritual depth at Yucatán, beach relaxation at Maroma. They're complementary rather than competing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Chablé good for honeymoons?",
      "answer": "Exceptional for couples seeking meaning over typical beach honeymoons. The cenote dinners, couple's treatments, and spiritual ceremonies create profound shared experiences. If you want parasailing and swim-up bars, look elsewhere. If you want to start marriage with intention, Chablé delivers."
