  "introduction": "Mexico City and Oaxaca represent two sides of Mexican cultural identity. The capital is a 22-million-person megalopolis with world-class museums, Aztec ruins beneath colonial buildings, and a food scene ranked among the planet's best. Oaxaca is an intimate colonial city where indigenous traditions run deep, mezcal flows freely, and every meal is a revelation. Both are essential—but if you only have time for one, which should it be? This guide breaks down the honest differences.",

      "content": "**Mexico City** is the complete Mexican primer—everything you could want from museums to street food to nightlife, compressed into a sprawling megalopolis that rewards exploration. It's essential for first-time visitors, museum lovers, and anyone who wants to understand Mexico's cultural breadth. The scale can be overwhelming, but that's part of its magic.\n\n**Oaxaca** is Mexico distilled to its essence—indigenous traditions, regional cuisine perfection, and artisanal craft heritage in a walkable, human-scale city. It rewards slower exploration and deeper connection. The mezcal, mole, and handmade textiles are reason enough to visit; the living Zapotec culture is the revelation.\n\n**The Honest Answer:**\n- **First trip to Mexico:** Start with Mexico City\n- **Foodie pilgrimage:** Oaxaca (but CDMX is close behind)\n- **Indigenous culture:** Oaxaca, definitively\n- **Museums and art:** Mexico City, no contest\n- **Day of the Dead:** Oaxaca and surrounding villages\n- **Limited time (4-5 days):** Mexico City offers more density\n- **Longer trip (7+ days):** Combine both\n\n**Our Recommendation:**\nBoth are essential Mexican experiences. If forced to choose, first-timers should see Mexico City; repeat visitors or culture-seekers should prioritize Oaxaca. The ideal trip includes both."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which is better for food—Mexico City or Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Both are exceptional food destinations, but with different strengths. Mexico City offers more variety (every regional cuisine, plus international) and world-renowned fine dining. Oaxaca is deeper but narrower—the best place to experience traditional moles, regional specialties, and mezcal culture. For pure culinary tradition and authenticity, Oaxaca edges ahead. For variety and contemporary Mexican cuisine, CDMX wins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you do both Mexico City and Oaxaca in one trip?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—they're only 1 hour apart by plane or 6-7 hours by bus. A 10-day trip with 4 days in CDMX and 4-5 in Oaxaca is ideal. Many travelers fly into Mexico City and out of Oaxaca (or vice versa) to avoid backtracking. The bus journey is comfortable and scenic if you have time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is safer—Mexico City or Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Both are safe for tourists exercising normal precautions. Oaxaca feels safer due to its smaller size and walkability—the historic center is safe even at night. Mexico City requires more awareness: stick to known neighborhoods (Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Coyoacán, Centro Histórico), use Uber after dark, and be vigilant about pickpockets in crowded areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should I go for Day of the Dead?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca is the best place in Mexico for authentic Day of the Dead celebrations. The villages surrounding Oaxaca City—especially Xoxocotlán, Atzompa, and Santa Cruz—host all-night cemetery vigils on November 1-2. Mexico City has celebrations too, especially the large parade on Reforma (a newer tradition inspired by the James Bond film), but Oaxaca's indigenous traditions are more authentic and moving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which city is cheaper—Mexico City or Oaxaca?",
      "answer": "Oaxaca is generally 20-40% cheaper across hotels, restaurants, and activities. Mexico City has budget options but also much higher ceilings for luxury spending. Both offer excellent value compared to US or European cities. Budget travelers can do well in either; luxury seekers will find more options in CDMX."
