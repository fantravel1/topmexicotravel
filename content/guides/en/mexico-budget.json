      "content": "1. **Eat where locals eat:** Follow the crowds to busy taquerias and market stalls. Best food, lowest prices.\n\n2. **Take advantage of comida corrida:** The midday meal deal (1-4pm) at casual restaurants offers incredible value—soup, main, drink, and dessert for $4-7.\n\n3. **Use Uber/DiDi:** Cheaper than taxis, no negotiating, and safer. Download both apps before arrival.\n\n4. **Travel overnight:** Long-distance ADO buses have fully reclining seats. Take night buses to save on accommodation.\n\n5. **Stay longer:** Weekly and monthly rentals on Airbnb can cut accommodation costs 30-50%.\n\n6. **Drink local:** Mexican beer and mezcal are cheap. Imported wine and spirits are expensive.\n\n7. **Visit museums on Sunday:** Many are free for Mexican residents, and some are free for everyone.\n\n8. **Book activities locally:** Tours booked through hotels cost 20-50% more than booking direct at the site or with local operators.\n\n9. **Carry cash:** Many small businesses, markets, and street food don't take cards. ATMs are everywhere.\n\n10. **Skip tourist restaurants:** Restaurants on main plazas charge 30-50% more. Walk one block away for better food at lower prices."

      "question": "How much money should I bring to Mexico for a week?",
      "answer": "For a comfortable mid-range trip, budget $600-1,000 USD per person for a week (excluding flights). This covers good hotels, restaurant meals, activities, and transport. Budget travelers can manage on $250-350, while luxury travelers should plan $1,500-2,500+."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it cheaper to pay in pesos or dollars?",
      "answer": "Always pay in pesos. While some tourist businesses accept dollars, they use unfavorable exchange rates. Withdraw pesos from ATMs (declining the machine's conversion rate) or use cards that don't charge foreign transaction fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I tip in Mexico?",
      "answer": "Tip 15-20% at restaurants (check if service is included), $2-5 USD per day for hotel housekeeping, $5-10 per person for tour guides, and round up taxi fares. Tips are genuinely appreciated as wages are low."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are all-inclusive resorts worth it?",
      "answer": "It depends. For pure beach relaxation with unlimited food and drink, all-inclusives can be good value ($200-400/day per person). However, you'll miss Mexico's incredible independent restaurants and cultural experiences. Consider splitting your trip—all-inclusive for relaxation, then independent travel for exploration."
