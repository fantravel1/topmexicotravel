  "introduction": "UNICO 20°87° (named for its exact coordinates) launched with a radical premise: what if an all-inclusive actively pushed guests to leave? The resort includes one excursion per stay because they want you to experience the real Riviera Maya. Local artisans created the décor, regional distilleries supply the tequila, and your personal \"host\" (they refuse to say butler) acts as cultural concierge. The result is a luxury all-inclusive that feels connected to place rather than isolated from it.",

      "title": "The Host Experience",
      "content": "**Personal Concierge Service:**\n\nUNICO's \"host\" concept replaces traditional butler service with cultural concierge. Your host handles practical needs but also connects you to authentic experiences.\n\n**What Hosts Do:**\n- Pre-arrival contact to understand preferences\n- Meet you at arrival, handle check-in\n- Restaurant reservations and recommendations\n- Excursion booking and customization\n- Cultural experience suggestions\n- Spa appointments\n- Special occasion arrangements\n- Problem resolution\n- Local tips and knowledge\n\n**The Difference:**\nTraditional butlers focus on luggage and room service. UNICO hosts focus on experience curation. They'll tell you where to find the best tacos in town, arrange a mezcal tasting with a local producer, or suggest the cenote that isn't crowded.\n\n**How to Use Your Host:**\n- Contact pre-arrival with interests\n- Share dietary restrictions\n- Ask for off-menu experiences\n- Request local recommendations\n- Let them handle problems\n- Tip appropriately (they're excellent)"
